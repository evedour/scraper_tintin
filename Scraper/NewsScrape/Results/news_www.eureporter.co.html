<p><strong><em>Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič will present the Commission’s second annual strategic foresight report on Wednesday (8 September). The report comes a week ahead of the annual ‘State of the EU’ address by the Commission president. The initiative is part of an effort to ensure that the EU is resilient in the face of challenges, but also able to prepare itself by embedding foresight into all aspects of policy making. The 2021 Report will look at structural global megatrends towards 2050 that are set to affect the EU, and will identify areas where the EU could boost its global leadership. </em></strong></p>



<p>On Tuesday (7 September) Commissioner Hahn will hold a press conference on the adoption of the Green Bonds Framework, the EUGBS (the European Green Bond Standard) aims to be a “robust tool to demonstrate that they are funding legitimate green projects aligned with the EU taxonomy”.</p>



<p>Parliament</p>



<p>Europe fit for the Digital Age Executive Vice President and Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will meet (6 September) with the chairs of five committees (INGE, ITRE, IMCO, LIBE, AIDA) in the parliament for an exchange of views on the digital agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Women’s Rights Committee and the delegation for relations with Afghanistan will meet to discuss the situation of women and girls’ rights.</p>



<p>The Special Committee on Beating Cancer will meet on Thursday (9 September) will meet to discuss the exchange of health data and the digitization in cancer prevention and care, as well as an update on the implementation of the EU’s chemicals strategy for sustainability in the context of cancer prevention.</p>



<p>The Subcommittee on Security and Defence will discuss the situation in Afghanistan, as well as a study on ‘EU preparedness and responses to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats’ and Sven Mikser MEP (S&amp;D, EE) draft report on ‘Challenges and prospects for multilateral Weapons of Mass Destruction arms control and disarmament regimes’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Court</p>



<p>European Union Court of Justice will give its opinion on the recovery of €2.7 billion from the UK for its failure to put in place a risk-based approach to customs control, despite repeated warnings from OLAF, the EU’s independent anti-fraud office. The failure to address this issue also meant that EU manufacturers had to compete with undervalued goods coming into the EU via the EU. OLAF’s figure covers the years 2011-2017. Other important judgements are expected in the field of Asylum (C-18/20, C-768/19).</p>



<p>Council</p>



<p>Agriculture and fisheries ministers will be meeting informally from 5-7. Economic and Finance ministers will have an informal meeting by video conference on 6 September, and will have another informal meeting on 10-11. As usual the Eurogroup will be meet ahead of the inclusive meeting on 10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECB</p>



<p>The European Central Bank will have its regular monthly meeting on Thursday, with inflation now exceeding 2% target, all eyes will be fixed on what the ECB will do next.</p>



<p>Tunisia</p>



<p>EU High Representative Josep Borrell will visit Tunisia on Friday (10 September). In July the Tunisian President Kais Saied dismissed the Prime Minister and suspected the parliament invoking emergency powers in the face of demonstrations over economic hardship and a rise in Covid-19 cases, The EU has called on Tunisia to respect its constitution and the rule of law.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="primary-image-caption"><strong>A truck with National Resistance Front markings is seen on a mountain top near Panjshir Valley, Afghanistan.</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The Taliban said on Sunday (5 September) their forces had fought their way into the provincial capital of the Panjshir valley, their latest claim of progress in fighting against opposition forces holding out in the area north of Kabul,</em></strong> <strong>writes James Mackenzie, <a>Reuters.</a></strong></p>



<p>There was no immediate response from the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRFA), which groups opposition forces. It had said earlier the Taliban "propaganda machine" was trying to spread distracting messages and that it had pushed Taliban forces back from another part of the valley.</p>



<p>Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said on Twitter the police headquarters and district centre of Rukhah, adjacent to the provincial capital Bazarak, had fallen, and opposition forces had suffered numerous casualties, with large numbers of prisoners and captured vehicles, weapons and ammunition.</p>



<p>Fighting was underway in Bazarak, he said. It was not possible to confirm the report, which was echoed on other Taliban Twitter accounts.</p>



<p>Earlier on Sunday NRFA spokesman Fahim Dashti said Parian district, at the northeastern end of Panjshir, which the Taliban have previously said they had taken, had been cleared and up to 1,000 Taliban, including Pakistanis and other foreigners had been blocked off and captured. It was not possible to confirm that independently.</p>



<p>"The resistance forces are ready to continue their defence against any form of aggression," Dashti said.</p>



<p>On Saturday, Italian aid group Emergency said Taliban fighters had reached the trauma hospital it operates in Anabah district, within the Panjshir valley.</p>



<p>Taliban officials have said previously their forces had secured full control of Panjshir but fighting has been continuing for days, with each side saying it had inflicted large numbers of casualties.</p>



<p>Ahmad Massoud, leader of the NRFA, has pledged to continue resisting the offensive and has called for international support.</p>



<p>Panjshir, a rugged mountainous valley north of Kabul still littered with the wreckage of destroyed Soviet tanks, has proved very difficult to overcome in the past. Under Massoud's late father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, it resisted both the invading Soviet army and the previous Taliban government.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Massoud said hundreds of Taliban fighters had surrendered to NRFA forces, which included remnants of regular Afghan army and special forces units as well as local militia fighters. It was not clear if that was a separate claim.</p>



<p>The Panjshir fighting has been the most prominent example of resistance to the Taliban, whose forces swept into Kabul on Aug. 15 as the Western-backed government collapsed and President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.</p>



<p>But small individual protests for women's rights or in defence of the green, red and black tricolour flag of Afghanistan have also been held in different cities.</p>



<p>Massoud originally called for a negotiated settlement with the Taliban and several attempts at talks were held but they eventually broke down, with each side blaming the other for their failure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>Secondary schools in all EU countries can now start enrolling for Juvenes Translatores, the European Commission's annual translation contest. From 12.00 CET on 2 September, schools can <a href="https://jt.ec.europa.eu/">register online</a> for their students to compete with peers around the EU. This year, the topic of the texts that young students are asked to translate is ‘Let's get on track – towards a greener future.'</em></strong></p>



<p>Budget and Administration Commissioner Johannes Hahn said: "The aim of the contest is to inspire young people to get interested in a career as translators and, in general, to promote language learning. The topic is in line with one of the EU's most important political priorities — the European Green Deal — which is of particular interest to young people. In addition to tackling this interesting subject, the aim of the competition is to bring together young people from different countries with a love for languages, to encourage them and help them overcome barriers between people and cultures. The ability to communicate with and understand one another, regardless of differences, is essential for the EU to flourish."</p>



<p>Participants can translate between any two of the EU's 24 official languages (552 possible language combinations). In last year's contest, students used 150 different combinations.</p>



<p>Registration for schools — the first part of the two-stage process — is open until <strong>12.00 CET on 20&nbsp;October 2021</strong>. Teachers can register in any of the EU's 24 official languages.</p>



<p>The Commission will then invite 705 schools to the next stage. The number of schools taking part in each country will be equal to the number of seats the country has in the European Parliament, with schools selected randomly by computer.</p>



<p>The chosen schools will then nominate up to five students to participate in the contest. They can be of any nationality but all participants must have been born in 2004.</p>



<p>The contest will be run online on 25&nbsp;November 2021 in all participating schools.</p>



<p>The winners — one per country — will be announced by early February 2022.</p>



<p>If conditions allow, they will be invited to receive their prizes in spring 2022 at a ceremony in Brussels. They will have the chance to meet professional translators from the European Commission and find out more about the profession and about working with languages.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The Commission's Directorate-General for Translation has organised the <em>Juvenes Translatores</em> (Latin for ‘young translators') contest every year since 2007. It promotes language learning in schools and gives young people a taste of what it is like to be a translator. It is open to 17-year-old secondary school students and takes place simultaneously in all selected schools across the EU.</p>



<p>The contest has inspired and encouraged some participants to study languages at university and go on to become professional translators. In addition, it provides an opportunity to showcase the EU's rich linguistic diversity.</p>

<p id="primary-image-caption"><strong>Moroccan Prime Minister Saad Eddine el-Othmani delivers his first speech presenting the government's program at the Moroccan Parliament. REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal/File Photo</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>When Moroccans elect a new parliament this week, it is likely to be a body with even less influence than its recent predecessors thanks to a new voting law and gradual moves by the king to reassert his dominant role, </em>write <a>Ahmed Eljechtimi</a> and <a>Angus Mcdowall</a>.</strong></p>



<p>A decade after Arab Spring protests led King Mohammed VI to give more powers to the elected parliament and the government it helps form, he has brought most major decisions back within the palace walls.</p>



<p>"In Morocco we have a strong institution, the monarchy, that overshadows the rest of political players," said Mohammed Masbah, head of an independent Moroccan think-tank.</p>



<p>Morocco's development plans and big economic projects have been initiated by the monarch rather than government, and rather than letting the premier - drawn from the biggest parliamentary party - select key ministers, the palace has done so itself.</p>



<p>With the advent of the pandemic the monarchy has further consolidated its executive authority, taking control of most strategic decisions from vaccine procurement to economic relief.</p>



<p>Often, Prime Minister Saad Dine El Otmani seemed to be the last person to know about major initiatives - including the deal last year to bolster ties with Israel, something he had denied would happen.</p>



<p>Now, a new voting law pushed by an interior minister who was selected by the palace will make it harder for big parties to gain a lot of seats, meaning parliament will be more fragmented and any government that emerges even weaker than previously.</p>



<p>Moroccans who hoped the Arab Spring reforms might lead to genuine electoral choices have been disappointed: the process of building coalitions and remaining in good odour with the palace have left most parties offering similar policies.</p>



<p>"In Morocco, the monarchy takes credit and the government takes the blame," said Masbah.</p>



<p>The PJD moderate Islamist party, which has won most seats in each election since 2011 and taken the lead in government formation, has arguably been the biggest political loser.</p>



<p>Caught between the palace's control of the biggest ministries and the need to share portfolios among coalition partners, it has had few cabinet posts. Meanwhile, parliament pushed through a law allowing cannabis cultivation against the position of the PJD.</p>



<p>The new voting law, which was also opposed by the PJD, will further reduce its influence by changing the way parliamentary seats are allocated, making it more difficult for parties to gain large numbers of seats.</p>



<p>"The electoral reforms... are likely to lead to the election of a highly fragmented parliament," said Amal Hamdan, an electoral systems analyst. That would likely weaken any government that emerged, further strengthening the monarchy, she said.</p>



<p>Had the law been applied in the 2016 election, the PJD would have had a quarter fewer seats and come second, said Abdelaziz Aftati, a senior PJD leader. Though election polls are banned, analysts expect the PJD to lose ground in the Sept. 8 vote.</p>



<p>The party believes it was drawn up specifically to cut its influence. However, despite being the biggest party in parliament and the leader of the coalition, it could not stop it being passed.</p>



<p>"We would will accept moving into opposition if it is the free will of the people expressed through fair elections. But not through undemocratic rules," said Aftati.</p>

<p><strong>A 31 August 2021 satellite image provided by Planet Labs shows the Uzbek camp, located just across the border from Afghanistan, which holds U.S.-trained Afghan pilots and other personnel. The personnel at the camp have been waiting for a U.S. evacuation for nearly three weeks and fear being handed over to the Taliban. Planet Labs/Handout via REUTERS</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The US-trained Afghan pilots and others held at a camp in Uzbekistan already feared being sent back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. So it was little comfort when an Uzbek guard unsympathetically quipped the other day: "You can't stay here forever," </em>writes <a>Phil Stewart</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The offhand warning added to an already grinding sense of unease at the camp just across Afghanistan's northern border, recounted one of the Afghan pilots who fled there with aircraft when ground forces fell to the Taliban in August as the United states and its allies withdrew their forces.</p>



<p>What follows is the first, detailed inside account among Afghans who, for nearly three weeks, have been waiting in vain to be evacuated by the United States.</p>



<p>"If they send us back, I'm 100 percent sure they'll kill us," said the pilot, who declined to be named because of fear of reprisal.</p>



<p>Speaking to Reuters on a cell phone that the Afghans there try to keep out of sight, the pilot described feeling like a prisoner, with highly restricted movement, long hours in the sun, and insufficient food and medicine. Some have lost weight.</p>



<p>"We are kind of like in jail," said the pilot, who estimates the Afghans held there number 465. "We have no freedom here."</p>



<p>Late August satellite images provided to Reuters showed high walls surrounding the camp, whose housing units had been used previously to treat COVID-19 patients and is near the city of Termez. Images shared with Reuters from inside showed sparse white rooms with bunk beds and no clutter - since most Afghans arrived with just the clothes on their backs.</p>



<p>Uzbek guards were armed, some with handguns and others with semi-automatic weapons, the pilot said.</p>



<p>The camp risks turning into another crisis for U.S. President Joe Biden, who was criticized left and right for the poor planning of evacuations that marked the end of America's longest war and the Islamist militant group's swift takeover.</p>



<p>Current and former US officials are critical of the failure of the US government so far to evacuate the Afghan personnel and aircraft in Uzbekistan, as current and former U.S. officials warn of Taliban pressure on Uzbek authorities to hand them over.</p>



<p>Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was "deeply concerned" about the Afghan pilots and other forces there.</p>



<p>"It is imperative that these personnel not fall into the hands of the Taliban both for their safety and the valuable technical knowledge and training they have," Reed told Reuters.</p>



<p>John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Uzbekistan, said he believed Uzbekistan faced real and substantial pressure from the Taliban to hand them over.</p>



<p>"They want to have good relations with Taliban. They don't want to provoke them, but they also don't want to provoke us," said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think-tank. He called for "competent statesmanship."</p>



<p>Retired U.S. Brigadier General David Hicks, who commanded the training effort for the Afghan Air Force from 2016 to 2017, said the State Department had failed to act fast enough after being supplied details about the Afghans being held at the camp from a network of current and former U.S. servicemembers and lawmakers.</p>



<p>"I'm not sure what they're doing at this point, to be honest," said Hicks, who is among those working to help the pilots and their families.</p>



<p>A State Department spokesperson said the United States was coordinating with Uzbekistan on the matter but stressed that Afghan personnel and aircraft were secure. It urged all of Afghanistan's neighbors to allow Afghans entry and to respect international law against returning refugees to countries where they are likely to face persecution.</p>



<p>Uzbekistan's government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>



<p>Even before the Taliban takeover, U.S.-trained, English-speaking pilots had become their prime targets. Taliban fighters tracked them down when they went off-base and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-pilots-assassinated-by-taliban-us-withdraws-2021-07-09" target="_blank"><strong>assassinated some pilots</strong>.</a></p>



<p>In the final days and hours before losing the war to the Taliban, some Afghan pilots staged a stunning escape by flying 46 aircraft out the country before the Taliban could take them - more than a quarter of the available fleet of about 160 planes.</p>



<p>Most flew from Kabul but some came from a base just across the border near the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, fleeing Taliban fighters who were storming the base after ground units collapsed. In a dramatic episode, one of the Afghan aircraft collided with an Uzbek jet, forcing the pilots to eject.</p>



<p>The Afghan pilot who spoke to Reuters estimated there were about 15 pilots who flew A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, 11 pilots who flew UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, 12 pilots who flew MD-530 helicopters and many Mi-17 helicopter pilots.</p>



<p>Besides dozens of pilots, there are Air Force maintenance personnel and other Afghan security forces at the camp. Some managed to cram family members onto aircraft but most are fearful for their loved ones across the border.</p>



<p>"There weren't any more ground forces. We fought until the last moment," the pilot said.</p>



<p>One US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, commended the Afghans in Uzbekistan for taking the planes out of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>"The only thing they knew to do was to fly every aircraft out of Taliban hands," the official said, adding: "They believed in us."</p>



<p>The Taliban did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Afghans in the Uzbek camp.</p>



<p>However, a senior Taliban leader, speaking to Reuters after the fall of Kabul, said his forces had captured drones and helicopters. But he longed for the return of the Afghan aircraft in Uzbekistan.</p>



<p>"Inshallah we will receive our remaining aircrafts, they are not in Afghanistan," he said.</p>



<p>The Taliban, which had no aircraft yet won the war, have also said they will be inviting former military personnel, including pilots, to join their new security forces. It says there will be no reprisal killings.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, officials from the U.S. government arrived at the camp to take biometric data from the Afghan personnel there, the pilot said.</p>



<p>"Fingerprints and also checking the IDs," he said.</p>



<p>The State Department did not respond to a question from Reuters about the visit.</p>



<p>The appearance of the US personnel lifted the mood somewhat, the pilot said, but there was still no clear indication of whether help was on its way.</p>



<p>The further the Taliban gets in establishing its government and relations with neighbors, the more risky their situation could become, the pilot said.</p>



<p>Experts on the region like Herbst, the former US ambassador, say Uzbekistan has every reason to seek a working relationship with the Taliban. That fear is shared among the Afghans at the camp.</p>



<p>"Most of the Air Force personnel, especially the pilots, they are educated in the US," the pilot said.</p>



<p>"They cannot (go to) Afghanistan and also those countries which probably...in the future will have good relations with the Taliban."</p>

<p><em><strong>As the dust settles behind America’s hasty retreat from Afghanistan, the Taliban now controls the country. The Afghan National Army (ANA) has collapsed. Former president Ashraf Ghani has fled. In a strategic failure, few could have anticipated the speed and ease with which Taliban forces entered Kabul, and fewer still will be able to predict what the future hold for Afghanistan, the region, and the world. For Europe, the U.S., and the great and regional powers: China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, India, &nbsp;– the implications of this shift are enormous: Afghanistan has always been a critical piece of the Eurasian geopolitical puzzle, and now enters a new era of the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40105749">Great Game</a>, </strong></em><strong>writes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/BarakSeener?lang=en" target="_blank">Barak Seener,</a> CEO of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.strategicintelligentia.com/" target="_blank">Strategic Intelligentia</a>&nbsp;and a former Middle East Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).</strong></p>



<p>Both Russia and China anchor their strategic partnership by jointly opposing the US’s primacy in global affairs. Their mutual belief is that Central Asia belong to their respective spheres of influence. Pakistan, Iran, and India have their own competing designs in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>But it is the nations of Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan – that may hold the key to Afghanistan’s future. Due to their geographic, cultural, and economic proximity, these countries can also expect to be the focus of the new Great Game between China, Russia, and the West. The United States and Europe should craft a modern and flexible strategy of engagement with Central Asia to keep extremists at bay and ensure that their rivals do not dominate the critical heartland of Eurasia.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan must form the backbone of any such strategy.</p>



<p>Home to the region’s largest territory, military, and economy, Nur-Sultan holds the key for all rivalling powers seeking to unlock Eurasia’s geoeconomic and geostrategic potential. First President Nursultan Nazarbayev began a market liberalization strategy at the outset of independence in 1991. By 2020, Kazakhstan’s total foreign direct investment stood at $161 billion, with $30 billion coming from the US. Kazakhstan is ranked by the World Bank as 25&nbsp;out of 150 indexed countries that is easy to do business.&nbsp;This is due to Kazakhstan developing a post-industrial economy based on renewable energy, high value-added agriculture, and services, and its new managerial class is developing a sophisticated financial sector based on<strong> <a href="https://www.aifc.kz/">Astana International Financial Centre</a></strong><a href="https://www.aifc.kz/">.</a></p>



<p>Due to being landlocked, Kazakhstan has pursued a successful ‘multi-vector’ foreign policy that is equidistant towards China, US, Russia, and the EU. This policy was formulated by Nazarbayev as early as the 1990s. To this end, Kazakhstan seeks to participate in both China’s BRI and the Moscow dominated Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) that includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>



<p>Russia, for its part, continues a foreign policy of irredentism vis-à-vis its former republics. Moscow maintains security interests in Central Asia with military bases in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sary_Shagan">Kazakhstan</a>,</strong> Kyrgyzstan and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russia-reinforce-military-base-tajikistan-report-2021-07-21/"><strong>Tajikistan</strong></a>. China’s economic imperialist Belt Road Initiative (BRI) continues apace. And the US? Despite its <strong><a href="https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf">2018 National Defense Strategy</a> </strong>shifting emphasis from counterinsurgency to great power competition, Washington has forfeited its presence in Afghanistan and limits regional investment. A ‘business as usual’ strategy will cede important trade routes rich in natural resources to Eurasia’s hegemons.</p>

<p>China and Russia are seeking to <a href="https://qz.com/2047680/why-arent-russia-and-china-evacuating-their-staff-from-kabul/"><strong>engage the Taliban</strong></a> to prevent Afghanistan’s power vacuum from spilling over across borders that may endanger their interests in BRI or the EAEU. Beijing and Moscow fear that Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan will be accompanied by a crime surge, narcotics and terrorism overflowing from its northern border to Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, threatening infrastructure in these states that provide vital energy and mineral exports, including oil and gas pipelines, which are of strategic importance to China. Furthermore, the economies of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are likely to suffer, if they are unable to develop trade routes south, to Pakistan and India via Afghanistan.</p>



<p>Over the past few years, China has met with Taliban delegations to discuss the Afghan peace process. In turn, the Taliban have never attacked Chinese infrastructure projects and in the medium to long-term, China will seek to cultivate relations with the Taliban. Beijing has offered infrastructure and energy projects as part of its BRI to the Taliban in return for them serving as a stabilizing force in Afghanistan. To this end, China is exploring to build new<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69110b85-bce9-45cb-a2f4-eadcd3edc6e3">road network</a></strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69110b85-bce9-45cb-a2f4-eadcd3edc6e3"> </a>for the Taliban following the US’s withdrawal and has offered “sizeable investments in energy and infrastructure projects.” Furthermore, China is planning as part of its BRI to build a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-has-a-big-plan-for-post-us-afghanistan-and-its-worth-billions?ref=scroll"><strong>motorway </strong></a>connecting&nbsp;Kabul and Peshawar enabling Afghanistan to join the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Similarly, Russia, Iran and Pakistan have all maintained relations with the Taliban in a bid to prevent the emergence of the Central Asian “Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K)”.</p>



<p>With the fall of Kabul, proactive engagement with Central Asia – Kazakhstan – may prove the most effective means for the West to mitigate the Afghan catastrophe and limit Chinese and Russian influence. The new era of the Great Game has begun.</p>

<p><strong><em>Germany called on the European Union last week to enable coalitions of the willing within the bloc to rapidly deploy a military force in a crisis as members discussed the lessons learned after the chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan, </em>write <a>Robin Emmott</a> and <a>Sabine Siebold</a>.</strong></p>



<p>EU efforts to create a rapid reaction force have been paralysed for more than a decade despite the creation in 2007 of a system of battlegroups of 1,500 troops that have never been used due to disputes over funding and a reluctance to deploy.</p>



<p>But the exit of US-led troops from Afghanistan has brought the subject back into <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/afghanistan-pullout-spurs-eu-revive-rapid-reaction-force-2021-09-01" target="_blank"><strong>the spotlight</strong></a>, with the EU alone potentially unable to evacuate personnel from countries where it is training foreign troops, such as in Mali. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/afghanistan-pullout-spurs-eu-revive-rapid-reaction-force-2021-09-01/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>



<p>"Sometimes there are events that catalyze history, that create a breakthrough, and I think that Afghanistan is one of these cases," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell (<em>pictured</em>) said in Slovenia, adding that he hoped for a plan in October or November.</p>



<p>Borrell urged the bloc to create a rapidly deployable "first entry force" of 5,000 troops to reduce dependence on the United States. He said President Joe Biden was the third consecutive U.S. leader to warn the Europeans that his country was pulling back from interventions abroad in Europe's backyard.</p>



<p>"It represents a warning for the Europeans, they need to wake (up) and to take their own responsibilities," he said after chairing a meeting of EU defence ministers in Slovenia.</p>



<p>Diplomats in the meeting told Reuters there was no decision on the way ahead, with the EU unable to agree on how it would quickly decide to authorise a mission without involving all 27 states, their national parliaments and those wanting United Nations approval.</p>



<p>Asked to comment on the German call, US State Department spokesman Ned Price said "a stronger, more capable Europe is in our shared interests" and that Washington strongly supported enhanced co-operation between the European Union and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance.</p>

<p>"NATO and the EU must forge stronger and institutional links and leverage each institution's unique capabilities and strengths to avoid duplication and potential waste of scarce resources," he told a regular news briefing.</p>



<p>The proposal from Germany, one of the strongest military powers in the EU but historically reluctant to send its forces into combat, would rely on a joint decision by the bloc but not necessarily all members deploying their forces.</p>



<p>"In the EU, coalitions of the willing could act after a joint decision of all," German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a tweet.</p>



<p>A rapid reaction force is seen as more likely now that Britain has exited the bloc. Britain, one of Europe's main military powers alongside France, had been sceptical of collective defence policy.</p>



<p>EU diplomats say they want a final deal on design and funding by March. France takes over the six-month EU presidency from Slovenia in January.</p>



<p>Kramp-Karrenbauer said the key question was not whether the EU would establish a new military unit, and the discussion must not stop there.</p>



<p>"The military capabilities in EU member countries do exist," she said. "The key question for the future of the European security and defence police is how we finally use our military capabilities together."</p>



<p>Slovenian Defence Minister Matej Tonin suggested that a rapid reaction force could comprise 5,000 to 20,000 troops but deployment should not depend on a unanimous decision by the EU's 27 states.</p>



<p>"If we are talking about the European battlegroups, the problem is that, because of the consensus, they are almost never activated," he told reporters.</p>



<p>"Maybe the solution is that we invent a mechanism where the classic majority will be enough and those who are willing will be able to go (ahead)."</p>
