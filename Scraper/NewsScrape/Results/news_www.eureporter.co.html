<p><strong><em>EU defence ministers met for an informal council to discuss the EU’s Strategic Compass - the EU’s plan to strengthen its capabilities and ability to respond in the field of security and defence - among other issues. On his way into the meeting, EU High Representative Josep Borrell said that recent events in Afghanistan could act like a catalyst, leading to a breakthrough in this area. </em></strong></p>



<p>The ministers will meet again in November in order to present a complete paper. The ‘Strategic Compass’ has four elements: crisis management, resilience, capability development, and partnerships. There has always been a yawning gap between the rhetoric on the EU’s aspirations in this field and reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK when it was an EU member was reluctant to participate in earnest, preferring NATO as its focus. When Macron called NATO “brain dead” he was heavily criticized, more Eastern members have also had a NATO focus and Germany has always seemed reluctant to lead in this field.</p>



<p>After yesterday’s meeting (2 September), German Federal Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer published a long twitter thread which presented some “sober truths”. Kramp-Karrenbauer said that Europeans had to withdraw from Afghanistan because of Europe’s own lack of military capability. She described the situation as a severe blow, but framed it not as a choice between NATO and the US or both, but as the moment for Europe to work together in order to make the western alliance stronger and put it on an equal footing with the US. ·</p>



<p>The central problem is how the EU can use its military capabilities and make its decision-making processes more effective with joint exercises and joint missions. Kramp-Karrenbauer calls for the use of Article 44 of the Treaty which would allow “coalitions of the willing”. She would like the EU to define regional responsibilities for security, joint training of special forces and joint organisation of important skills such as strategic air transport and satellite reconnaissance. It remains to be seen if momentum following events in Afghanistan can be sustained.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>On 5 and 6 September, Health and Food Safety Commissioner Stella Kyriakides</em> (pictured)<em>, will participate in a meeting of health ministers organized by the Italian Presidency of the G20. The meeting will focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global health and its consequences in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. It will call for more action in favor of a "one health" and a better interconnection between animal and human health, environmental conditions as well as global cooperation to support equitable access to disease control tools such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. </em></strong></p>



<p>Prior to her participation, Commissioner Kyriakides said: “The pandemic has clearly demonstrated how our global health systems are interconnected. The main lesson learned from the COVID-19 crisis is the crucial role of global cooperation and coordinated actions. The European Union has been at the forefront of the collective response to these challenges, both internally and globally, and I look forward to a meeting in which a new coherent global health security architecture and complete will be discussed.

<p><strong><em>The European Commission has approved, under EU state aid rules, a €10 million Irish scheme to support the fishery sector affected by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and the consequent quota share reductions foreseen in the provisions of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the EU and the UK. The support will be available to companies that commit to temporarily cease their fishing activities for a month. </em></strong></p>



<p>The aim of the scheme is to save part of the Irish reduced fishing quota for other vessels, while the beneficiaries temporarily suspend their activities. The compensation will be granted as a non-refundable grant, calculated on the basis of gross earnings averaged for the fleet size, excluding the cost of fuel and food for the crew of the vessel. Each eligible company will be entitled to the support for up to a month in the period between 1 September to 31 December 2021. The Commission assessed the measures under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows Member States to support the development of certain economic activities or regions, under certain conditions.The Commission found that the measure enhances the sustainability of the fishery sector and its ability to adapt to new fishing and market opportunities arising from the new relationship with the UK. </p>



<p>Therefore, the measure facilitates the development of this sector and contributes to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term. The Commission concluded that the measure constitutes an appropriate form of support in order to facilitate an orderly transition in the EU fishery sector following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. On this basis, the Commission approved the scheme under EU State aid rules. </p>



<p>Today's (3 September) decision does not prejudge whether the support measure will eventually be eligible for Brexit Adjustment Reserve ‘BAR' funding, which will be assessed once the BAR Regulation has entered into force. However, it already provides Ireland with legal certainty that the Commission considers the support measure to be compliant with EU State aid rules, irrespective of the ultimate source of funding. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.64035 in the <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/register/">state aid register</a> </strong>on the Commission's <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html"><strong>competition</strong></a> website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>As the global nature conservation community gathers in Marseille for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iucncongress2020.org/" target="_blank">IUCN World Conservation Congress</a>, at which marine protection targets will be discussed, Oceana releases new data revealing how EU countries continue to allow destructive fishing in Europe’s supposedly ‘protected’ areas and calls on European leaders to ban the widespread  and destructive practice of bottom trawling. Oceana’s analysis found that over 2.5 million hours of bottom fishing occurred in 2020 inside areas designated to protect Europe’s most valuable and threatened marine species and habitats.</em></strong></p>



<p>“As country leaders proudly communicate their ocean protection efforts at international events, they often fail to mention the harmful fishing that is going on inside their marine ‘protected’ areas. We urge them to truly protect our marine environment by banning harmful activities, and in particular destructive fishing, from all marine protected areas” said Oceana Advocacy in Europe Senior Director<strong> </strong>Vera Coelho.</p>



<p>Oceana analyzed satellite tracking-data of fishing boats, based on Global Fishing Watch<sup>1</sup>, and focusing on European Natura 2000 sites. The analysis found that five German sites are within the top 10 most bottom-trawled sites in Europe, including the “Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park” with over 730,000 hours alone. The data reveals other intensely bottom-trawled sites including the French “Mers Celtiques - Talus du golfe de Gascogne” (117,574 hours), the Dutch “Noordzeekustzone” (117,683 hours) and ”Waddenzee” (110,451 hours), as well as the Danish “Skagens Gren og Skagerak” (49,092 hours).</p>



<p>Oceana’s analysis showed that about 75% of the bottom fishing activity is carried out by beam-trawling<sup>2</sup>, a particularly harmful fishing technique used to catch flat fish (such as sole or plaice), which consists of dragging heavy nets attached to a steel beam that holds the nets open on the seafloor.</p>



<p>2021 is a critical year for Nature and Ocean protection, as international discussions are taking place under the United Nations to adopt a new global framework to reverse biodiversity loss by mid-century. Negotiations are ongoing about a target to protect at least 30% of the planet (land and sea) by 2030, and leaders are expected to also discuss the issue at the IUCN Congress. An Oceana-led <a href="https://act.wemove.eu/campaigns/bottom-trawling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition</a> has already gathered almost 150,000 signatures urging the European Commission to act to ban bottom trawling in all EU MPAs in its upcoming Action Plan on the oceans expected in early 2022. <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Top 10 most bottom-fished Natura 2000 sites in Europe (2020)</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MPA name</strong></td><td><strong>EU country</strong></td><td><strong>Total </strong><strong>2020 </strong><strong>bottom-fishing </strong><strong>recorded in the MPA (</strong><strong>hours</strong><strong>)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Nationalpark Niedersächsisches Wattenmeer</td><td>Germany</td><td>732 775</td></tr><tr><td>Wattenmeer und angrenzende Küstengebiete</td><td>Germany</td><td>576 393</td></tr><tr><td>Sylter Außenriff</td><td>Germany</td><td>318 582</td></tr><tr><td>Noordzeekustzone</td><td>The Netherlands</td><td>117 683</td></tr><tr><td>Mers Celtiques - Talus du golfe de Gascogne</td><td>France</td><td>117 574</td></tr><tr><td>Waddenzee</td><td>The Netherlands</td><td>110 451</td></tr><tr><td>Doggerbank (German part)</td><td>Germany</td><td>93 092</td></tr><tr><td>Skagens Gren og Skagerak</td><td>Denmark</td><td>49 092</td></tr><tr><td>Steingrund</td><td>Germany</td><td>41 832</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Natura 2000 is the largest network of protected areas in the world and represents between 70 to 80% of the marine protected areas (MPAs) in EU Member States. Oceana analysed 1,928 European MPAs (all Natura 2000 sites) designated for habitat protection, in which bottom-fishing activities took place in 2020 (excluding fishing signals of less than 1 hour). In total 2,580,656 hours of bottom-fishing were recorded, inside 343 Natura 2000 sites in 20 EU member states.</p>



<p>Fishing data is based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals from Global Fishing Watch (GFW), cross-referenced with the European Fleet Register. However, as some boats can turn their AIS off and vessels under 15m are not required to carry it in Europe, findings are likely to be an underestimate of fishing activity. The 2020 fishing activity was also affected by the COVID19 pandemic and therefore could be below normal levels.</p>



<p>Global Fishing Watch is an international non-profit organization dedicated to advancing ocean governance through increased transparency of human activity at sea.</p>



<p>The rest of the fishing activity concerns the following gears: bottom pair trawls, bottom trawls, nephrop trawls, single boat bottom otter trawls, twin bottom otter trawls, twin trawls, mechanised dredges including suction dredges, and towed dredges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>The head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the</em> </strong><em><strong>Near East (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, acknowledged that Palestinian textbooks contain problematic material, while still insisting that the agency takes steps to prevent it from being taught, without showing that how this is actually accomplished</strong>, </em><strong>writes <a href="https://ejpress.org/author/yossi/">Yossi Lempkowicz</a>.</strong></p>



<p>He stated, in a hearing before the European Parliament’s foreign affairs committee (AFET),&nbsp; that antisemitism, intolerance glorification of terrorism is present in PA textbooks in UNRWA schools and affirmed that his agency had revised the textbooks used in its schools following allegations of antisemitic content.</p>



<p>But several members of the committee questioned him on continued teaching of hate, violence&nbsp;and antisemitism in Palestinian Authority (PA) textbooks and UNRWA materials, citing a recent report by IMPACT-se, &nbsp;an organization that analyzes schoolbooks and curricula for compliance with UNESCO-defined standards on peace and tolerance. on the textbooks.</p>



<p>The EU is UNRWA’s largest and most consistent institutional donor.  In June, European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi, whose department covers aid to UNRWA, issued statements <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=8879e27454&amp;e=8a937a57c3"><strong>calling</strong></a> to consider conditioning aid to the Palestinian education sector on “full adherence to UNESCO standards of peace, tolerance, co-existence, non-violence” and a “<a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=a4246e421f&amp;e=8a937a57c3"><strong>need for Palestinian education reform</strong></a>”.</p>



<p>Also in June, a cross-party group of 26 EU Parliament from 16 countries and from the largest political groups sent a <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=8d0102c344&amp;e=8a937a57c3"><strong>letter</strong></a> to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres,  calling for disciplinary action and investigation of UNRWA over hate teaching.</p>



<p>In April, the EU Parliament passed an unprecedented<strong> <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=474a1359ac&amp;e=8a937a57c3">resolution</a> </strong>condemning UNRWA, becoming the<strong> <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=9e49823174&amp;e=8a937a57c3">first legislature</a> </strong>to censure UNRWA over teaching hate and incitement to violence using Palestinian Authority textbooks. The<strong> <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=a429eac985&amp;e=8a937a57c3">adopted text</a> </strong>demanded that hateful material be “removed immediately” and insists that EU funding “must be made conditional” on educational material promoting peace and tolerance.</p>



<p>At the AFET meeting, Lazzarini stated that “we largely agree with the conclusion that there are&nbsp;a number of issues needing to be addressed.”</p>



<p>But he was challenged by several parliamentarians. German MEP Dietmar Köster, a member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=d55d7d8231&amp;e=8a937a57c3"><strong>questioned</strong></a> Lazzarini on the textbooks. “UNRWA admitted that between March and November 2020, its own education directors produced educational material branded with UNRWA logo that incites to violence, calls for jihad and rejects peacemaking as identified in IMPACT-se report.</p>



<p><em>“</em>I have serious concerns regarding the textbooks. In view of UNRWA’s serious shortcomings in recent years, I believe the European Parliament has no other choice but to discuss the question of whether we need stricter oversight over the agency. Please explain,” he said.</p>



<p>Spanish MEP Jose Ramon Bauza Diaz, of the liberal Renew Europe group posed a similar<strong> <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=c57ad19ac6&amp;e=8a937a57c3">question</a></strong>. <em>“</em>There are mentions of terrorism in certain texts and of course various countries in the EU have decided to block their contributions to this agency. For this reason, it would be very serious for the money of European taxpayers to pay for encouragement of terrorism or to foster corruption.”</p>



<p>Slovak MEP Miriam Lexmann, from the European People’s Party, the largest political group in the EU parliament, <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=ac8c595f62&amp;e=8a937a57c3"><strong>challenged</strong></a> Lazzarini when she asked: “What concrete steps have been taken? What has been done to collect these materials back from 320,000 students? We know if these books remain with the students, they will create further damage.’’</p>



<p>She mentioned the fact that the U.S. State Department accountability office (GAO) report on UNRWA said that UNRWA teachers ”have refused to take part in training for tolerance and conflict resolution.’’</p>



<p>Dutch MEP Bert-Jan Ruissen, from the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group,<strong> <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=5f2e534de5&amp;e=8a937a57c3">said</a></strong>: “We need to look at the recent IMPACT-se report….it shows that in the new textbooks of UNRWA there is daily mention of violence and rejection of peace and denial of the legitimacy of Israel in terms of presence in the region. I think there is a question of how long we can tolerate this.  What have you done about our concerns expressed in relation to school textbooks?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>What is the main purpose of civil society? A space free from politics? Mediating institutions independent of the state? A rival object of loyalty and affiliation to Ideology and Party? While thinkers as far back as de Tocqueville, have quibbled over the question, all have agreed on civil society’s importance. At its best, it builds social trust and cohesion. Offering a source of meaning to citizens in letting them help their fellow countrymen. Traditionally, civil society - the nexus of institutions from community groups to non-governmental organizations, labour unions to religious institutions - stopped at the borders of the nation. After all, people tend to know their own circumstances best. And before modern communication technology, they were less able - and inclined - to concern themselves with the affairs of far-away lands</em></strong>, <strong>writes Colin Stevens.</strong></p>



<p>But increasingly, NGOs seem devoted to just that - the affairs of far-away lands. Alas, many of these lands, they do not understand half as well as they think. Nonetheless, Western governments and NGOs increasingly feed off each other in fuelling their overseas adventures. A symbiotic relationship whereby NGOs provide the groundwork that legitimises more concrete - if counter-productive - government action.</p>



<p>Indeed, the US government often relies on supposedly independent NGOs as ‘objective’ sources of information, when shaping policy. One of the most influential is the prestigious NGO<strong> <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/"><u>Freedom House</u></a></strong>. By the end of 2019, Freedom House raised $48 million - 94% from the coffers of Uncle Sam. Its chairman of the board was the Secretary of Homeland Security under George Bush. And its current president, a lifelong American diplomat.</p>



<p>One might not regard an outfit with such incestuous links to the US government as a natural port of call for journalists seeking an“independent non-governmental organization.” Yet that is exactly how the press treats it. And to some effect. Freedom House has represented the American foreign policy establishment since the US achieved hegemony in the mid-20th century. Indeed, the organization, founded during WWII, could count Eleanor Roosevelt among its leaders. And after successfully pushing for entry into World War II, it went on to forthrightly and successfully advocate for embarking upon the Cold War. But while its website takes great pains to stress these facts, it is more recalcitrant about its recent track record.</p>



<p>In fact, the Freedom House website fails to mention Iraq even once, despite its ex-Chairman<strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._James_Woolsey_Jr."><u>R. James Woolsey, Jr. </u></a></strong>being the former head of the CIA. The same man who in the wake of 9-11, Paul Wolfowitz<strong> <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/special-reports/iraq-intelligence/article24463585.html">sent to the UK</a></strong> to find evidence that Saddam Hussein was behind the assault on the Twin Towers. The same man, who told The Guardian’s David Rose in October that year, that only Iraq had the capability to produce airborne anthrax spores (precipitating a next-day article fallaciously headlined<strong><em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/terrorism.afghanistan6"><u>Iraq Behind U.S. Anthrax Outbreaks</u></a></em></strong>, which ‘informed’ readers of the “growing mass of evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved, possibly indirectly, with the 11 September hijackers”). And the very same man who in 2003<strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/20/usa.terrorism">called Iraq a “war for freedom”,</a> </strong>burnishing his claim with the credibility derived from his former role at the CIA but also from his then-current one as Chairman of Freedom House.</p>



<p>That such a figure headed up the preeminent foreign policy NGO, speaks volumes. And yet this is how the International Civil Society of the 21st-century functions. Western NGOs can always be counted on to satisfy policy-makers’ perennial lust for clumsy intervention overseas. Even as the domestic civil societies of Western nations fray at the seams.</p>



<p>But this is the inevitable result of trying to buy civil societies with Western funds. For civil societies do not yield so easily to market logic. Functional ones cannot be bought. They must be grown. Indeed, far from helping, throwing money often compounds the problem. And yet more money keeps being thrown. Already, one-fifth of international aid is via NGOs. At the level of bilateral aid, 23 per cent of U.S assistance programmes are channelled to the sector. This combined with low barriers to entry and lacklustre oversight has perverted incentives. As NGOs have grown fat on the bounty, many have also grown corrupt. Stories of NGO scandals abound. Take <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2014/05/30/somaly-mam-holy-saint-and-sinner-sex-trafficking-251642.html"><u><strong>Somaly Mam</strong></u></a>, where in 2014 the CEO (and founder) of the anti-sex-trafficking NGO, was found to have fabricated stories of abuse about herself and others. Or the Honduran non-profits The Dibattista Foundation and Todos Somos Hondurenos, which between 2010 and 2014, swindled 12 million dollars from the country’s already depleted Treasury. Or <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti"><u>Oxfam’s sex scandal</u></a> </strong>in 2018, where during missions in Haiti and Chad, members of the prestigious NGO paid for prostitutes with donated funds. Or the telling but sobering fact that 11 out of 17 of France's largest NGOs refused to participate in a confidential Médecins du Monde study on corruption.</p>



<p>So, far from building social trust in the developing world, NGOs have atrophied it. Trying to circumvent the perceived corruption of local governments, Western donors have merely displaced it. Overly dependent on troughs of foreign funds, these NGOs lack domestic support. Instead viewed simply as instruments of overseas interference.</p>



<p>The recent situation of Myanmar is emblematic of this dynamic. A group of NGOs have written a letter urging the Norwegian PM to stop a Norwegian telecommunications company from selling its stake in Myanmar to Lebanese firm <a href="https://www.m1group.com/"><u><strong>M1 Group</strong></u></a>. The Norwegian state-controlled giant Telenor sold in response to the recent military coup and the NGOs allege M1 Group won’t uphold the same privacy standards that a Western company like Telenor would. But this concerted manoeuvre raises many questions. What is the track record of these NGOs in pushing for foreign intervention? How well do they understand the situation in Myanmar? And how much funding do they get from Western governments - each with their own ulterior motives?</p>



<p>If these foreign-funded NGOs are to ever gain the trust of the people they claim to speak for, then these questions must be answered. And answered honestly and forthrightly. But they won’t be. For an honest reckoning would reveal them for what they are. Not a burgeoning civil society. But simply the Missionaries of the 21st Century - seeking to protect the benighted natives from their own devices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Today (3 September) the EU and AstraZeneca have reached an agreement which will secure the delivery of the remaining COVID-19 vaccine doses to member states under the terms of the Advance Purchase Agreement concluded on 27 August 2020 with AstraZeneca. The agreement will also end the pending litigation before the Brussels Court.</em></strong></p>



<p>Health and Food Safety Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said: "Today's settlement agreement guarantees the delivery of the remaining 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses by AstraZeneca to the EU. While this week we reached the important milestone of 70% full vaccination of the EU's adult population, there are significant differences in vaccination rates between our member states, and the continued availability of  vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remain crucial. And as the strongest supporter of global vaccine cooperation and solidarity, we will continue helping the rest of the world. Our aim is to share at least 200 million doses of vaccines through COVAX with low and middle-income countries until the end of this year. Vaccine solidarity is and remains our trademark."</p>



<p>This settlement agreement provides for the firm commitment by AstraZeneca to deliver, in addition to the around 100 million doses delivered until end of Q2, 135 million doses by the end of 2021 (60 million doses by the end of Q3 and 75 million doses by the end of Q4) and the remaining doses (65 million) by the end of March 2022.This will bring the total number of doses delivered to 300 million doses as agreed under the contract.</p>



<p>Member states will be provided with regular delivery schedules and capped rebates will apply in the event of any delayed doses.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The European Commission presented on 17 June a<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-eu-strategy-covid-19-vaccines_en">European strategy</a></strong> to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, the Commission finances part of the upfront costs faced by vaccines producers in the form of Advance Purchase Agreements.</p>



<p>In view of the current and new escape SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Commission and the member states are negotiating with companies already in the EU vaccine portfolio new agreements that would allow to purchase rapidly adapted vaccines in sufficient quantities to reinforce and prolong immunity.</p>



<p>In order to purchase the new vaccines, Member States are allowed to use the <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/coronavirus-response/react-eu">REACT-EU</a> </strong>package, one of the largest programmes under the new instrument Next Generation EU that continues and extends the crisis response and crisis repair measures.</p>
