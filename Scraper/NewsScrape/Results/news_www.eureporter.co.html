<p><strong><em>As millions of pupils and teachers in Europe start the new school year, the Commission continues to accompany and support them. The pandemic has highlighted schools' capacity to innovate, but also outlined significant difficulties to adapt and to ensure quality and inclusive education for all learners. The EU supports student and teacher exchanges across Europe in different formats and collaboration aimed at promoting quality and inclusion, and supporting the digital and green transitions. The Commission has put forward many actions at EU level for schools, gathered around several topics: promoting cooperation and mobility; investing in education and skills; working towards educational success and inclusion; providing advice and platforms for online co-operation; supporting the green transition through education, and much more. </em></strong></p>



<p>For instance, from this year on, also pupils from general school education can fully benefit from<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1326">Erasmus+</a></strong> and go abroad, individually or with their class. This means that now all learners have access to the same opportunities, be they in schools, in vocational education and training, or higher education. With over €28 billion for 2021-2027, the new Erasmus+ programme has almost doubled its budget compared to the previous period. More than €3.1bn is dedicated to mobility and cooperation projects in general school education, and more than €5.5bn will contribute to co-fund such projects in the vocational education and training sector. Projects have already been approved for more than 7,000 schools, with more expected in September and October. In addition to the increased Erasmus+ budget, about €60bn will be channelled to investments in education and skills in national recovery plans, corresponding to more than 10% of the total <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en#the-recovery-and-resilience-facility">Recovery and Resilience Facility</a> </strong>budget. More actions are coming before the end of the year, for instance the launch of the first<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/european-innovative-teaching-award_en">European Innovative Teaching Award</a>s</strong>. The award will showcase innovative teaching and learning practices developed in Erasmus+ transnational co-operation projects. For more information on the actions of the Commission in the field of education, please consult<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/education/news/back-to-school-eu-support_en">this page</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The ‘<a href="https://www.connectingeuropeexpress.eu/">Connecting Europe Express'</a>, a special train put together as part of the <a href="https://europa.eu/year-of-rail/index_en">European Year of Rail</a> 2021, will pull out of Lisbon train station today (2 September). It will stop in more than 100 towns and cities during its five-week journey, before arriving in Paris on 7 October. Departing from Lisbon and ending its trip in Paris, the train will make a notable stop in Ljubljana, connecting the Portuguese, Slovenian and French Presidencies of the Council of the EU. </em></strong></p>



<p>Transport Commissioner Adina Vălean said: “Rail has shaped our rich, common history. But, rail is also Europe's future, our route to mitigating climate change and powering economic recovery from the pandemic, as we build a carbon-neutral transport sector. Over the coming weeks, the Connecting Europe Express will become a rolling conference, laboratory and forum for public debate on how to make rail the transport mode of choice for passengers and businesses alike. Please give us a warm welcome when we stop at a railway station near you.” </p>



<p>Along the route, various events are planned to welcome the train at railway stations across Europe. Rail enthusiasts can also follow debates happening on board as well as<strong> <a href="https://www.connectingeuropeexpress.eu/event/">conferences</a> </strong>on EU infrastructure policy and the role of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t_en"><strong>Trans-European Transport Network</strong></a> (TEN-T), that will be livestreamed via the <strong><a href="https://www.connectingeuropeexpress.eu/">event website</a> </strong>from Lisbon, Bucharest, Berlin and Bettembourg. The Connecting Europe Express is the result of unique cooperation between the European Commission and the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies (CER), European rail operators, infrastructure managers and numerous other<strong> <a href="https://www.connectingeuropeexpress.eu/partners/">partners</a> </strong>at EU and local level. A press release is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4483"><strong>online</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Russia will soon deliver a huge military hardware consignment to Belarus, including aircraft, helicopters and air defence systems, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was quoted as saying on Wednesday (1 September) by the Belta news agency,</em></strong> <strong>write Nastya Teterevleva, Maxim Rodionov and Tom Balmforth, <a>Reuters</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The delivery is likely to be interpreted as a further sign of Moscow's unwavering support for Lukashenko who faced down the biggest opposition protests of his rule last year by overseeing a violent crackdown condemned by the West.</p>



<p>Russian and Belarusian forces are set to hold large joint military exercises later this month. Russia sees its Belarusian ally as a security buffer on its western flank against the NATO military alliance and the European Union.</p>



<p>"Russia in the near future...will supply us - I won't say how much money or what - with dozens of planes, dozens of helicopters, the most important air defence weapons," Lukashenko was quoted as saying.</p>



<p>"Maybe even S-400s (surface-to-air missiles). We need them very much as I've said in the past," he said.</p>



<p>Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to hold talks in Russia on 9 September.</p>



<p>Russia and Belarus are formally part of a "union state" and have been in talks for years to further integrate their nations.</p>



<p>The negotiations have long spurred fears among the beleaguered Belarusian opposition that Lukashenko might trade off chunks of sovereignty in return for even more political backing from the Kremlin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>Poland's Constitutional Tribunal again postponed on Tuesday (31 August) a planned ruling on whether the country's constitution or European Union treaties take precedence, a verdict that could call into question the bloc's legal order, </em>write Alan Charlish, <a>Anna Wlodarczak-semczuk</a>k in Warsaw, <a>Sarah Morland</a> in Gdansk and Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels.</strong></p>



<p>Proceedings, originally set for July, were adjourned until Sept. 22 following a motion from Poland's Human Rights Ombudsman that one of the judges, former ruling party lawmaker Stanislaw Piotrowicz, should not participate as he had been involved in judicial reforms opposed by Brussels.</p>



<p>"A judge of the Constitutional Tribunal whose attitude towards the EU is marked by far-reaching criticism or even hostility cannot adjudicate on the constitutionality of EU treaties," said the office of ombudsman Marcin Wiacek, who was nominated by the opposition and appointed by parliament in July.</p>



<p>The catalyst for Tuesday's sitting had been a long-running dispute with the EU over changes to the court system in Poland. Brussels is angered by what it sees as attempts to undermine the independence of the judiciary. Warsaw accuses Brussels of unjustified meddling in its internal affairs.</p>



<p>The primacy of EU laws over national ones is a key tenet of European integration. Opposition politicians say Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki's challenge to this tenet not only jeopardises Poland's long-term future in an EU that has helped drive its economic growth, but also the stability of the bloc itself.<strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polands-tusk-says-conflicts-with-eu-could-eventually-end-bloc-2021-07-16/">Read more</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"It would lead to Europe a la carte, where different countries apply the EU law differently... (EU law) needs one referee, and the referee is the European Court of Justice," said European Values and Transparency Commissioner Vera Jourova.</p>



<p>Poland argues that the EU treaties do not give Brussels the right to interfere with the judicial systems of member states.</p>



<p>"The constitution is the highest law in our country," Cabinet Minister Michal Wojcik said in a statement to Reuters. "If it were otherwise, it would mean that we are not a sovereign state. We did not agree to this in the EU treaties."</p>



<p>Some lawyers use the term "Polexit" to describe what they say are Warsaw's efforts to remove itself from the EU's legal framework, but Poland is unlikely to exit the bloc anytime soon.</p>



<p>The EU has no legal way to expel countries and surveys show an overwhelming majority of Poles support membership. But some government critics say Poland risks an eventual loss of EU funding.</p>



<p>The government has been accused of politicising the judicial system, including the Constitutional Tribunal. Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says the reforms were needed to remove communist-era influence.</p>



<p>The EU's top court also ruled last month that a Polish disciplinary chamber for judges was illegal, a day after the Constitutional Tribunal in Warsaw ruled that Poland should ignore a previous demand to stop the chamber operating.</p>



<p>Following a threat of possible EU financial penalties, Poland said it would disband the chamber, but failed to detail how it would replace it. Brussels has yet to comment on Warsaw's response other than to say that it is analysing it. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-says-will-dismantle-disciplinary-chamber-judges-2021-08-17/"><strong>Read more. </strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>South Louisiana braced for a month without electricity and reliable water supplies</em></strong> <strong><em>in the wake of Hurricane Ida, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US Gulf Coast, as people faced suffocating heat and humidity,</em></strong> <strong>write <a>Devika Krishna Kumar</a>, <a>Nathan Layne</a>, Devikda Krishna Kumar in New Orleans, Peter Szekely in New York, Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut, Barbara Goldberg in Maplewood, New Jersey, Maria Caspani in New York and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru, Maria Caspani and Daniel Trotta.</strong></p>



<p>The storm killed at least four people, officials said, a toll that might have been much larger if not for a fortified levee system built around New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago.</p>



<p><strong>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3yrcULP" target="_blank">Graphic of Hurricane Ida hitting Gulf Coast</a>)</strong></p>



<p>By early Tuesday, about 1.3 million customers were without power 48 hours after the storm made landfall, most of them in Louisiana, said<strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://poweroutage.us" target="_blank">PowerOutage</a></strong>, which gathers data from U.S. utility companies.</p>



<p>Officials were unable to complete a full damage assessment because downed trees clogged roads, said Deanne Criswell, chief of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>



<p>Compounding the suffering, the heat index in much of Louisiana and Mississippi reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), the National Weather Service said.</p>



<p>"We all want air-conditioning ... Even if you have a generator, after so many days they fail," said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards.</p>



<p>"Nobody is satisfied" with the estimate that power might not be restored for 30 days, he added, expressing hope that the 20,000 line workers in the state and thousands more en route could finish sooner.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden offered federal help in restoring power during a call with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the chiefs of two of the Gulf Coast's largest utilities, Entergy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ETR.N" target="_blank">(<strong>ETR.N</strong>)</a> and Southern Co <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SO.N" target="_blank">(<strong>SO.N</strong>)</a>, the White House said.</p>



<p>At Ochsner St. Anne Hospital southwest of New Orleans, 6,000-gallon tanker trucks pumped fuel and water into tanks to keep its air-conditioning running. The medical center closed to all but a few emergency patients.</p>



<p>New Orleans' restaurants, many shut ahead of the storm, also face an uncertain future because of a lack of electricity and facilities, reviving memories of the difficulties that plagued businesses for weeks in the wake of Katrina.</p>



<p>"This is definitely feeling like Katrina," said Lisa Blount, a spokesperson for the city's oldest eatery, Antoine's, which is a landmark in the French Quarter. "To hear the power is potentially out for two to three weeks, that is devastating."</p>



<p>Even the power generators were hazardous. Nine people in St. Tammany Parish northeast of New Orleans were taken to hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning from a gas-fueled generator, media said.</p>

REUTERS/Marco Bello"/></figure>



<p>Roughly 440,000 people in Jefferson Parish south of New Orleans may be without electricity for a month or more after utility poles toppled, Councilman Deano Bonano said, citing comments by power officials.</p>



<p>"The damage from this is far worse than Katrina, from a wind standpoint," Bonano said in a telephone interview.</p>



<p>Among the four dead were two killed in the collapse of a southeastern Mississippi highway that critically injured 10 more. One man died attempting to drive through high water in New Orleans and another when a tree fell on a Baton Rouge home.</p>



<p>Swampy areas south of New Orleans took the brunt of the storm. High waters finally receded from the highway to Port Fourchon, Louisiana's southernmost port, leaving a trail of dead fish. Seagulls swarmed the highway to eat them.</p>



<p>Port Fourchon suffered extensive damage, with some roads still blocked. Officials were only letting through emergency responders to Grand Isle, a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico. It could take weeks for roads to be cleared, they said.</p>



<p>A line of cars stretched at least a mile from a gas station stocked with fuel in Mathews, a community in Lafourche parish.</p>



<p>More than half the residents of Jefferson Parish rode out the storm at home, Bonano said, and many were left with nothing.</p>



<p>"There are no grocery stores open, no gas stations open. So they have nothing," he said.</p>



<p>The weakened remnants of the storm dumped heavy rain in neighboring Mississippi as it traveled toward Alabama and Tennessee. Heavy rainfall and flash flooding were possible on Wednesday (1 September) in the mid-Atlantic region and southern New England, forecasters said.</p>



<p>Sheriff's deputies in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana were investigating the disappearance of a 71-year-old man after an apparent alligator attack in the flood waters.</p>



<p>The man's wife told authorities that she saw a large alligator attack her husband on Monday in the tiny community of Avery Estates, about 35 miles (55 km) northeast of New Orleans. She stopped the attack and pulled her husband from the water.</p>



<p>His injuries were severe, so she took a small boat to get help, only to find her husband gone when she returned, the sheriff's office said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pope Francis </em>(pictured) <em>is not thinking of resigning and is living "a totally normal life" following intestinal surgery in July, he said in a radio interview broadcast on Wednesday (1 September),</em></strong> <strong>write <a>Philip Pullella</a> and Inti Landauro in Madrid.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking to Spanish radio network COPE, Francis, 84, dismissed an Italian newspaper report that he might step down, saying: "I don't know where they got it from last week that I was going to resign ... it didn't even cross my mind."</p>



<p>He also said he was almost certain to attend the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November.</p>



<p>In the interview, the pope thanked a male nurse at the Vatican for convincing him to undergo surgery to remove part of his colon rather than continuing treatment with antibiotics and other medicines, as some doctors had favoured.</p>



<p>"He saved my life," the pope said.</p>



<p>Francis, who was elected pontiff in 2013, underwent surgery on July 4 and spent 11 days in hospital. He had been suffering from a severe case of symptomatic diverticular stenosis, a narrowing of the colon.</p>



<p>"Now I can eat everything, which was not possible before ... I lead a totally normal life," he said, adding that 33 centimetres (13 inches) of his intestine was removed.</p>



<p>He further dismissed the report of his potential resignation by outlining his full schedule, with a trip to Hungary and Slovakia on Sept. 12-15 and visits to Cyprus, Greece and Malta in the pipeline as well his planned attendance at COP26.</p>



<p>Newspaper Libero reported on Aug. 23 that there was "a conclave in the air" at the Vatican - a reference to the secret meeting at which cardinals choose a new pope when the incumbent dies or resigns. It said Francis had spoken of resigning, possibly to coincide with his 85th birthday in December.</p>



<p>"Whenever a pope is ill there is always a breeze or a hurricane about a conclave," he told COPE.</p>
