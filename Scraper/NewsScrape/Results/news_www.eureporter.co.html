<p><strong><em>Good afternoon, health colleagues, and welcome to the European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM) update of the week – as the days speed by, it is now high time to register for the upcoming EAPM event on 17 September that will take place during the ESMO Congress, details below</em>, writes EAPM Executive Director Denis Horgan.</strong></p>



<p><strong>‘Cancer in its many forms’</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned in previous updates, the conference, EAPM’s ninth annual event, is entitled ‘<em>The need for change – and how to make it happen: Defining the health-care ecosystem to determine value</em>’. The event will take place on Friday, 17 September from 08h30–16h00 CET; here is the&nbsp;<a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8598554080238105611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>link to register</strong></a>&nbsp;and here is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euapm.eu/pdf/EAPM_Conference__The_need_for_change_%E2%80%93_and_how_to_make_it_happen_-_Defining_the_healthcare_ecosystem_to_determine_value.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>link to the agenda</strong></a>.</p>



<p>This dynamics series of roundtable will look at different elements of this through the following sessions:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Session I: Winning Stakeholders' Trust In Genomic Data Sharing and the use of Real World Evidence/Data</li><li>Session II: Bringing Molecular Diagnostics into healthcare Systems</li><li>Session III Regulating the future - Balance of patient safety and facilitating innovation – IVDR</li><li>Session IV: Saving lives through health data collection and usage</li></ul>



<p>Many of the points that are highlighted below will be discussed at the conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Data points way forward to beating cancer</strong></p>



<p>Parliament’s Special Committee on Beating Cancer (BECA) convened on Thursday (9 September) to focus on two key cancer care and research issues. First up on the Committee’s agenda was a discussion with the European Commission on the creation of a European Health Data Space.</p>



<p>The Commission’s Beating Cancer Plan envisages electronic health records playing a crucial role in cancer prevention and care and is looking to make the most of the potential of data and digitalisation, through its European Health Data Space initiative to improve cancer treatment, healthcare delivery and quality of life outcomes.</p>



<p>BECA Committee MEPs also held an exchange of views with the Commission on progress around the implementation of the so-called Chemicals Strategy for Innovation, which aims to deliver high levels of health and environmental protection from chemicals.</p>



<p>The strategy is seen as another key component of the Commission’s Beating Cancer Plan as it seeks to reduce citizen’s exposure to carcinogenic substances and other hazardous chemicals.</p>



<p>“The COVID pandemic has again demonstrated the fact that we are struggling to use data in order to inform the policymaking and decision-making processes,” said Ioana <strong>Maria Gligor,</strong> head of unit for European reference networks and digital health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission is looking to fix that with a legal proposal scheduled for the beginning of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gligor explained that the idea is to allow health data to flow seamlessly to wherever it’s needed: between hospitals inside a country, but also between countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As of 2022, we are aiming to support access of patients to their own health data on their smart devices,” the Commission official explained. Things like genomic data can be invaluable to help diagnose rare cancers in patients, for example. And massive stores of anonymized patient data can also be used to help drive disease research using machine learning tools.</p>



<p><strong>Slovenia moves EU data bill closer to the finish line</strong></p>



<p>Slovenia has sharpened the restrictions for the international flows of European industrial data in a bill meant to encourage EU countries and companies to share data with each other.</p>



<p>Following in Portugal’s footsteps, the Slovene presidency of the EU clarified rules on the international transfer of industrial data and made small tweaks in the Data Governance Act in the fifth compromise text circulated on 7 September.<br><br>EU countries will discuss the compromise text on 14 September.</p>



<p><strong>Eurobarometer results</strong></p>



<p>The European Union has been working to contain the spread of the coronavirus, support national health systems, protect and save lives, as well as counter the socio-economic impact of the pandemic at both the national and EU level. Actions culminated in the Commission’s proposal for a Recovery Fund and modified multiannual budget for the EU, providing for an unprecedented level of support to help overcome the crisis.</p>



<p>Three out of four respondents across all countries surveyed say they have heard, seen or read about EU measures to respond to the Coronavirus pandemic; a third of respondents <strong>(33%)</strong> also know what these measures are. At the same time around half <strong>(52%)</strong> of those who know about EU action in this crisis say they are not satisfied with the measures taken so far.</p>



<p>Nearly seven out of ten respondents (69%) want a stronger role for the EU in fighting this crisis. In parallel, almost six out of ten respondents are dissatisfied with the solidarity shown between EU member states during the pandemic. While 74% of respondents have heard about measures or actions initiated by the EU to respond to the pandemic, only 42% of them are satisfied with these measures so far.</p>



<p>Around two-thirds of respondents (69%) agree that “the EU should have more competences to deal with crises such as the coronavirus pandemic”. Less than a quarter of respondents (22%) disagree with this statement.</p>



<p>This strong call for more EU competences and a more robustly co-ordinated EU response goes hand in hand with the dissatisfaction expressed by a majority of respondents as concerns the solidarity between EU member states in fighting the coronavirus pandemic: 57% are unhappy with the current state of solidarity, including 22% who are ‘not at all’ satisfied.</p>



<p><strong>Farm to Fork Strategy</strong></p>



<p>The European Parliament’s &nbsp;Environment (ENVI) committees are voting on their joint own-initiative report on the Farm to Fork Strategy, which sets out how the EU aims to make the food system “fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly”. MEPs from both committees are expected to approve their joint Farm to Fork Strategy report on Friday and send it to plenary for a final vote scheduled for early October.&nbsp;<br><br>And a group of lawmakers, led by the Greens’ <strong>Martin Häusling</strong>, are threatening to block the delegated act when it comes to the plenary of the European Parliament next week, arguing that the conditions it sets out are not sufficiently protective of human health. Overusing antibiotic drugs to treat farm animals will worsen the global problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which has been termed the silent pandemic.<br><br>“Failure to move forward with these restrictions will be a missed opportunity. We do not have time to waste in fighting AMR,” <strong>Kyriakides</strong> said in the agriculture committee today.<br><br>The controversial delegated act is part of the revision of the EU’s animal health laws, which will start to apply from January 2022.</p>



<p><strong>Good news to finish: Ministers hoping vaccines watchdog will back mass rollout of booster jabs&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>UK ministers have piled pressure on the vaccines watchdog to approve a large-scale programme of Covid booster injections in time for winter, as the number of people in hospital with the virus exceeded 8,000 for the first time since March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday (9 September) the UK’s medicines regulator granted emergency approval for the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to be used as third shots to tackle potentially waning immunity, also putting pressure on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to approve a new jab programme. Hours later, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said he was confident that such injections would begin imminently. “We are heading towards our booster programme,” he said. “I’m confident that our booster programme will start later this month, but I’m still awaiting the final advice.”</p>



<p><strong>And that is all for this week from EAPM - don't forget, here is the&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8598554080238105611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>link to register</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for EAPM's 17 September conference, and here is the&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.euapm.eu/pdf/EAPM_Conference__The_need_for_change_%E2%80%93_and_how_to_make_it_happen_-_Defining_the_healthcare_ecosystem_to_determine_value.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>link to the agenda</strong></a><strong>. Until next week, stay safe and well, and have a lovely weekend!</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The European Parliament’s Budget Committee will meet at the end of this month to vote on 2022 allocations to the Palestinian Authority. Several proposals have been tabled to freeze a portion of funding to the PA until the textbooks are changed, </em>writes <a href="https://ejpress.org/author/yossi/">Yossi Lempkowicz</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of a crucial vote on next year EU funding to the Palestinian Authority (PA), a senior European Commission official stated that PA textbooks are deeply ‘’problematic’’ and can no longer be tolerated in their current form as they perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by promoting hatred and violence, alongside employing antisemitic tropes.   </p>



<p>At a meeting of the European Parliament’s<strong> <a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=f09582eb2b&amp;e=8a937a57c3">Working Group Against Antisemitism</a></strong> on Thursday in Brussels to discuss EU study on Palestinian textbooks, Henrike Trautmann, head of unit at the European Commission Directorate General which oversees all aid to the Palestinian education sector, said: “It is very clear that the study does reveal the existence of very deeply problematic content…changes to the curriculum are essential…full compliance of all educational material with UNESCO standards of peace, tolerance, coexistence and non-violence must be ensured as must any reference of antisemitic nature need to be addressed and taken out.”</p>



<p>The EU study, by German Georg Eckert Institute reviewing the Palestinian textbooks, was published last June.</p>



<p>At the EU Parliament meeting, &nbsp;members of the committee condemned antisemitism and glorification of violence in the PA curriculum.&nbsp;EU Parliament Vice-President Nicola Beer, a member of the liberal Renew Europe political group, clearly tied European funding to the PA to hate teaching:</p>



<p>“It hurts us to read about the content of textbooks that only exist thanks to an educational infrastructure that the European Union, together with other donors, enable the Palestinian Authority to have. Depicting Jews as dangerous, demonizing them, perpetuating anti-Jewish prejudices is just upsetting. But reading about schoolbooks – and here I speak as a mother – glorifying terrorist Dalal al-Mughrabi, presenting cold-blooded violence against civilians, including a lot of children as resistance leaves me speechless.”</p>



<p>The European Parliament’s Budget Committee will meet at the end of this month to vote on 2022 allocations to the Palestinian Authority.&nbsp;Several proposals have been tabled to freeze a portion of funding to the PA until the textbooks are changed.</p>



<p>Two weeks ago, at a hearing of the European Parliament foreign affairs committee, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, acknowledged that Palestinian textbooks contain problematic material, while still insisting that the agency takes steps to prevent it from being taught, but without showing that how this is actually accomplished.</p>



<p>He also stated that antisemitism, intolerance glorification of terrorism is present in PA textbooks in UNRWA schools and affirmed that his agency had revised the textbooks used in its schools following allegations of antisemitic content.</p>



<p>But several members of the committee questioned him on continued teaching of hate, violence&nbsp;and antisemitism in the textbooks and UNRWA materials, citing a recent report by IMPACT-se, &nbsp;an organization that analyzes schoolbooks and curricula for compliance with UNESCO-defined standards on peace and tolerance. on the textbooks.</p>



<p>The EU is UNRWA’s largest and most consistent institutional donor.</p>



<p>In June, European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi, whose department covers aid to UNRWA, issued statements <strong><a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=8879e27454&amp;e=8a937a57c3">calling</a> </strong>to consider conditioning aid to the Palestinian education sector on “full adherence to UNESCO standards of peace, tolerance, co-existence, non-violence” and a “<a href="https://impact-se.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&amp;id=a4246e421f&amp;e=8a937a57c3"><strong>need for Palestinian education reform</strong></a>”.</p>

<p><strong><em>Regardless of one’s ideological disposition, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is a reality. For some the swiftness of the collapse of the Ghani Government has been stunning. For others a slow-burn predictable eventuality. A military solution was never tenable for long term security of the region and true national development of Afghanistan. Today’s reality is an amalgam of repeated mistakes by many actors, </em>writes Ambassador Farukh Amil, pictured below.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/screenshot_2020-11-25_at_12.10.39.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/screenshot_2020-11-25_at_12.10.39.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-118420" width="210" height="118" srcset="https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/screenshot_2020-11-25_at_12.10.39.jpg 650w, https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/screenshot_2020-11-25_at_12.10.39-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a></figure>



<p>Interventionist wars prosecuted with fire-starter foreign policies have repeatedly ended in misery for all concerned. There is no happy ending in the self-deluding mantras&nbsp;of ‘he must go’ or ‘there will be consequences’.&nbsp; Many a time those consequences are both cruel and unintended. An honest appraisal is necessary not only for the untold number of Afghan victims but also for those sent on a mission “to do the job”. The world owes them this much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crisis now unfolding in Afghanistan is the humanitarian one with thousands wanting to leave. Globally the appetite for receiving refugees has shrunk dramatically. Europe in particular seems to be in the midst of refugee-fatigue, especially after the bitter Syrian experience which contributed to the rise of anti-EU nationalistic and xenophobic forces. It is highly unlikely that any Western country would be prepared to repeat the generosity for the Afghans shown for the Syrians by Chancellor Merkel as the moral leader of the Western Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The total collapse in Kabul must be looked at in development terms. No doubt much progress had been made, in education, women empowerment, the media and urban development. A closer look would reveal many uncomfortable truths. The words of the veteran UN diplomat Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi ring true to this day. As the UN Special Representative in Afghanistan (2001-2004), arguably the toughest period in revengeful days following 9/11, Brahimi likened the foreign intervention as a kind of spacecraft that had landed in the dusty wilderness. Inside were all modern amenities: electricity, hot food, showers, toilets. Outside in comparison, at the perimeter, Afghans peered in from their darkened world. Clearly, if development was not inclusive, it was doomed from the start.</p>



<p>Fast forward to another leading voice at the UN, the American economist Jeffrey Sachs who said that of the $2 trillion plus exhausted on Afghanistan, only $21 billion was spent “in economic support”, arguing that this was less than 2% of the entire US spending on Afghanistan. Whilst a key goal was to win hearts and minds, such figures cannot lend themselves to any form of optimistic outcome.</p>



<p>Everyone wants peace and an end to the suffering of Afghans. Most of all the Afghans themselves. Countries bordering Afghanistan want regional stability for economic progress. It is and never has been in Pakistan’s interests to pursue strategies that promote instability in Afghanistan. Rather, still carrying the largest refugee population for the longest period of time since the end of the Second World War, Pakistan continues to shoulder responsibilities and that too without recourse to xenophobic domestic politics. And once again with the evacuation from Kabul, Pakistan has stepped up&nbsp;with a helping hand with hundreds of flights arriving in Pakistan ferrying nearly 10,000 evacuees so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are plenty of balanced voices in the West. These need to be heard and not be drowned out by angry, missile-toting interventionists who refuse to learn the lessons of history. Mature voices such as the influential US Senator Lindsey Graham are already pressing home sensible points. Whilst it is understandable and easy to judge the emerging ‘new’ Taliban in Afghanistan from its past actions, if anything, perhaps it is now the time to give peace a chance. However, this new dispensation in Kabul must be judged by its actions. Right now it can only make promises that the international community should ideally help them keep. It is the preferred outcome for Pakistan that an inclusive Government emerges in Kabul through an Afghan-owned consensus and one that respects human rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Taliban requests the international community to reopen its Embassies it would be prudent to do so once the security situation stabilizes, if only to temper any feared excesses through engagement. Otherwise what is certain is the impending humanitarian crisis. For those who are celebrating, for whatever reason, there are words of caution. One should bear in mind the views of the former UN SRSG for Afghanistan Kai Eide, who said that “18 million people need humanitarian assistance and you cannot let them down.” If the international community turns its back on Afghanistan it will only embolden those who want to inflict chaos. A grass roots development oriented re-engagement that is gradual and conditional is the only sensible path forward at this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the alternative? To abandon the Afghan people at this juncture is unnecessarily cruel. What would be the goal of such a policy? Collective punishment of 40 million people? And the direct consequences? The generation of refugee outflows ? Sanctions have shown time and again that the ruling elites remain unaffected and only the poor suffer. And in Afghanistan’s case, could engender some awful outcomes internationally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>The European Commission has decided to register a European Citizens' Initiative entitled ‘Ensuring Common Commercial Policy conformity with EU Treaties and compliance with international law'.</em></strong></p>



<p>The organizers of the initiative call on the Commission to "propose legal acts based on the Common Commercial Policy to prevent EU legal entities from both importing products originating in illegal settlements in occupied territories and exporting to such territories, in order to preserve the integrity of the internal market and to not aid or assist the maintenance of such unlawful situations".</p>



<p>The Commission considers that this European Citizens' Initiative is legally admissible, as it meets the necessary registration conditions. It is important to highlight, that the initiative invites the Commission to submit a proposal for a legal act under the Common Commercial Policy, which is general in nature and does not target a specific country or territory. The Commission has not analyzed the substance of the initiative at this stage.</p>



<p>With today's decision, the Commission is reassessing the proposed initiative following additional information received from the organisers and a ruling of the General Court on a previous Commission decision.</p>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>Following today's registration, the organisers can start the process of collecting signatures. If a European Citizens' Initiative receives one million statements of support within one year from at least seven different Member States, the Commission will have to react. The Commission could decide either to follow the request or not, and in both instances would be required to explain its reasoning.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The European Citizens' Initiative was introduced with the Lisbon Treaty as an agenda-setting tool in the hands of citizens. It was officially launched in April 2012.</p>



<p>The conditions for admissibility are: (1) the proposed action does not manifestly fall outside the framework of the Commission's powers to submit a proposal for a legal act, (2) it is not manifestly abusive, frivolous or vexatious and (3) it is not manifestly contrary to the values of the Union.</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the European Citizens' Initiative, the Commission has received 107 requests to launch one, 83 of which were in fields where the Commission has the power to propose legislation and thus qualified to be registered.</p>

<p><strong><em>On the occasion of the International Day to Protect Education from Attack (9 September), the EU reaffirms its commitment to promote and protect the right of every child to grow in a safe environment, have access to quality education, and build a better and more peaceful future</em></strong>, <strong>says Janez Lenarčič (pictured).</strong></p>



<p>Attacks on schools, students and teachers have a devastating impact on access to education, education systems and on societal development. Sadly, their incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. This is all too clear from the recent developments in Afghanistan, and the crises in Ethiopia, Chad, Africa's Sahel region, in Syria, Yemen or Myanmar, amongst many others. The Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack has identified more than 2,400 attacks on education facilities, students, and educators in 2020, a 33 percent increase since 2019.</p>



<p>Attacks on education constitute also violations of International Humanitarian Law, the set of rules seeking to limit the effects of armed conflict. Such violations are multiplying, while their perpetrators are seldom called to account. In this view, we are putting compliance with International Humanitarian Law consistently at the heart of the EU's external action. As one of the largest humanitarian donors, the EU will hence continue to promote and advocate for global respect for International Humanitarian Law, both by states and non-state armed groups during an armed conflict.</p>



<p>Beyond destruction of facilities, attacks on education result in long-term suspension of learning and teaching, increase the risk of school dropouts, lead to forced labour and recruitment by armed groups and forces. School closures reinforce exposure to all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence or early and forced marriage, levels of which have increased drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated the vulnerability of education worldwide. Now, more than ever, we need to minimise disruption to education disruption, and ensure that children can learn in safety and protection.</p>



<p>Safety of education, including further engagement on the Safe Schools Declaration, is an integral part of our efforts to protect and promote the right to education for every girl and boy.</p>



<p>Responding to and preventing attacks on schools, supporting protective aspects of education and protecting students and teachers requires a coordinated and inter-sectoral approach.</p>



<p>Through EU-funded projects in Education in Emergencies, we help reduce and mitigate the risks posed by armed conflict.</p>



<p>The EU remains at the forefront of supporting education in emergencies, dedicating 10% of its humanitarian aid budget to support access, quality and protection of education.</p>

<p><strong><em>The EU is strengthening its ability to respond to new security risks and emerging technologies. The new <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2021:206:FULL&amp;from=EN">Export Control Regulation</a> entered into force on 9 September and will tighten controls on trade in dual-use items – civilian goods and technologies with possible military or security use – while enhancing the EU's capacity to protect human rights and support secure supply chains for strategic items.</em></strong></p>



<p>Executive Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis (<em>pictured</em>) said: “We need to better respond to emerging threats in an increasingly volatile world. That means getting a better grip on dual-use technologies, including cyber-surveillance technologies that can be misused for human rights violations. Thanks to these new EU rules, the EU countries will now also work even more closely amongst themselves and with allies on potential security risks arising from biotech, Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies. We will also team up to ensure a level playing field for companies, for example, in the context of the new EU-US Trade and Technology Council.” </p>



<p>The new framework allows the EU to take a number of important actions to pool expertise and tackle particular challenges, notably in relation to cyber-surveillance – where due diligence guidelines are in preparation – but also emerging dual-use technologies such as advanced computing.</p>



<p>The regulation introduces greater transparency by increasing the level of consultations and reporting between member states and the Commission, contributing to the development of a new<strong> <a href="https://webgate.acceptance.ec.europa.eu/frontoffice/welcome">EU electronic licensing platform</a></strong> already piloted in four EU member states.</p>



<p>It also provides a legal basis for EU action at multilateral, plurilateral and bilateral levels – recognising that the effectiveness of controls depends on the cooperation of the main technology producers – and builds on the existing multilateral framework of export controls, namely the Wassenaar Arrangement, which forms the basis for many restrictions imposed by the regulation at EU level.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>The Commission adopted its legislative proposal to modernise EU controls on exports of sensitive dual-use items - goods and technology - in September 2016, to replace the Regulation from 2009. Such items have many civilian uses but can also be used for defence, intelligence and law enforcement purposes (nuclear and special materials, telecommunication, electronics and computers, space and aerospace, marine equipment, etc.), and may also be misused for human rights violations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Regulation includes many of the Commission proposals for a comprehensive ‘system upgrade', and will make the existing EU Export control system more effective by:</p>



<ul><li>Introducing a novel ‘human security' dimension, so the EU can respond to the challenges posed by emerging dual-use technologies – especially, cyber-surveillance technologies – that pose a risk to national and international security; including protecting human rights;</li><li>updating key notions and definitions (e.g. definition of an ‘exporter' to apply to natural persons and researchers involved in dual-use technology transfers);</li><li>simplifying and harmonising licensing procedures and allowing the Commission to amend – by ‘simplified' procedure, i.e. delegated act – the list of items or destinations subject to specific forms of control, thereby making the export control system more agile and able to evolve and adjust to circumstances;</li><li>enhancing information exchange between licensing authorities and the Commission with a view to increasing the transparency of licensing decisions;</li><li>coordination of, and support for, robust enforcement of controls, including enhancing secure electronic information exchange between licensing and enforcement agencies;</li><li>developing an EU capacity-building and training programme for member states' licensing and enforcement authorities; </li><li>outreach to industry and transparency with stakeholders, developing a structured relationship with the private sector through specific consultations of stakeholders by the relevant Commission group of member states' experts, and;</li><li>enabling stronger dialogues with third countries and seeking a level playing field at the global level.</li></ul>

<p><strong><em>The Commission has adopted its second annual <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/foresight_report_com750_en.pdf">Strategic Foresight Report – 'The EU's capacity and freedom to act</a>'. This Communication presents a forward-looking and multidisciplinary perspective on the EU's open strategic autonomy in an increasingly multipolar and contested global order. The Commission has identified four main global trends, affecting the EU's capacity and freedom to act: climate change and other environmental challenges; digital hyperconnectivity and technological transformation; pressure on democracy and values; and shifts in the global order and demography. It has also set out 10 key areas of action where the EU can seize opportunities for its global leadership and open strategic autonomy. Strategic foresight thereby continues to inform the Commission's Work Programmes and priority-setting.</em></strong></p>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “European citizens experience almost on a daily basis that global challenges such as climate change and digital transformation have a direct impact on their personal lives. We all feel that our democracy and European values are being put into question, both externally and internally, or that Europe needs to adapt its foreign policy due to a changing global order. Early and better information about such trends will help us tackle such important issues in time and steer our Union in a positive direction.”</p>



<p>Vice President Maroš Šefčovič, in charge of interinstitutional relations and foresight, said: “While we cannot know what the future holds, a better understanding of key megatrends, uncertainties and opportunities will enhance the EU's long-term capacity and freedom to act. This Strategic Foresight Report therefore looks into four megatrends with a major impact on the EU, and identifies ten areas of action in order to boost our open strategic autonomy and cement our global leadership towards 2050. The pandemic has only strengthened the case for ambitious strategic choices today and this report will help us keep an eye on the ball.”</p>



<p><strong>Ten strategic areas of policy action</strong></p>



<ol><li>Ensuring sustainable and resilient health and food systems;</li><li>securing decarbonised and affordable energy;</li><li>strengthening capacity in data management, artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies;</li><li>securing and diversifying supply of critical raw materials;</li><li>ensuring first-mover global position in standard setting;</li><li>building resilient and future-proof economic and financial systems;</li><li>developing and retaining skills and talents matching EU ambitions;</li><li>strengthening security and defence capacities and access to space;</li><li>working with global partners to promote peace, security and prosperity for all; and</li><li>strengthening the resilience of institutions.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>The Commission will continue to implement its Strategic Foresight Agenda for this policy cycle, informing Work Programme initiatives for next year. On 18-19 November, it will host the annual<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/organisation/espas-european-strategy-policy-analysis-system_en#:~:text=%2Forbis%2Fespas%2F-,ESPAS%20is%20an%20inter%2Dinstitutional%20collaboration%20among%20the%20officials%20of,which%20monitors%20global%20trends%20and">European Strategy and Political Analysis System (ESPAS) conference</a></strong> to discuss the topic of next year's Strategic Foresight Report – the twinning of the green and digital transitions, i.e. how they can mutually reinforce each other, including by using emerging technologies. Furthermore, the EU-wide Foresight Network of the “Ministers for the Future” in all Member States will continue to build foresight capacity in EU Member State administrations. Later this month, the Commission will also finalize a public consultation on its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/strategic-planning/strategic-foresight/2020-strategic-foresight-report/resilience-dashboards_en"><strong>resilience dashboards</strong></a>, a new tool to assess resilience in a more holistic manner, in the EU and its Member States. This will contribute to measuring social and economic wellbeing by going beyond GDP. A<strong> <a href="mailto:jrc-resilience@ec.europa.eu">public consultation</a> </strong>on the Commission's draft resilience dashboards is ongoing until 30 September.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Strategic foresight supports the Commission on its forward-looking and ambitious path towards achieving President von der Leyen's six headline ambitions. Beginning in 2020, annual Strategic Foresight Reports are prepared, based on full foresight cycles, to inform the priorities of the annual State of the Union speech, the Commission Work Programme and multi-annual programming.</p>



<p>This year's report builds on the 2020 Strategic Foresight Report, which introduced resilience as a new compass for EU policymaking. The megatrends and policy actions laid out in the 2021 Strategic Foresight Report were identified through an expert-led, cross-sectoral foresight exercise conducted by the Commission services, with broad consultations of member states, and other EU institutions in the framework of the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS). The results of the foresight exercise are presented in a <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC125994"><strong>Joint Research Centre Science for Policy report: Shaping and securing the EU's Strategic Autonomy by 2040 and beyond</strong>.</a></p>



<p>To support building foresight capacities across the EU, the Commission established the EU-wide Foresight Network, including 27 Ministers for the Future from all member states. This network shares best practices and informs the Commission's strategic foresight agenda by discussing key issues of relevance for Europe's future.</p>
