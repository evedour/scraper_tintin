<p>Ida weakened into a tropical storm over southwestern Mississippi early on Monday (30 August), the National Hurricane Center said, but it is expected to continue unleashing heavy downpours "likely to result in life-threatening" flooding.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/idas-fury-cuts-deep-into-us-oil-production-gasoline-supplies-2021-08-30/" target="_blank"><strong>The full extent </strong></a>of storm damage remained to be seen at daybreak.</p>



<p>Sunday night (29 August), the sheriff's office in Ascension Parish reported the first known US fatality from the storm, a 60-year-old man killed by a tree falling on his home near Baton Rouge, the state capital.</p>



<p>Ida, the first major hurricane to strike the United States this year, made landfall around noon on Sunday as a ferocious Category 4 storm over Port Fourchon, a hub of the Gulf's offshore oil industry, packing sustained winds of up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).</p>



<p>Its arrival came 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina, one of the most catastrophic and deadly U.S. storms on record, struck the Gulf Coast, and about a year after the last Category 4 hurricane, Laura, battered Louisiana.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in the state, ordering federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in more than two dozen storm-stricken parishes.</p>



<p>Ida crashed ashore as Louisiana was already reeling from a resurgence of COVID-19 infections that has strained the state's healthcare system, with an estimated 2,450 COVID-19 patients hospitalized statewide, many in intensive care units.</p>



<p>A loss of generator power at the Thibodaux Regional Health System hospital in Lafourche Parish, southwest of New Orleans, forced medical workers to manually assist respirator patients with breathing while they were moved to another floor, the state Health Department confirmed to Reuters.</p>



<p>Within 12 hours of landfall, Ida had weakened into a Category 1 hurricane on the five-level Saffir-Simpson scale, with top winds clocked at 85 mph (135 kph) as the storm pushed about 100 miles inland past New Orleans, Louisiana's largest city, early on Monday.</p>

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo"/></figure>



<p>By then, Ida had plowed a destructive path that submerged much of the state's coastline under several feet of surf, with flash flooding reported by the National Hurricane Center across southeastern Louisiana.</p>



<p>Nearly all offshore Gulf oil production was suspended in advance of the storm, and major ports along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts were closed to shipping.</p>



<p>Power was knocked out Sunday night to the entire New Orleans metropolitan area following the failure of all eight transmission lines that deliver electricity to the city, the utility company Entergy Louisiana reported.</p>



<p>One transmission tower collapsed into the Mississippi River, the Jefferson Parish Emergency Management Department said.</p>



<p>More than 1 million Louisiana homes and businesses in all were without electricity by late Sunday night, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.US.</p>



<p>Residents of the most vulnerable coastal areas were ordered to evacuate days ahead of the storm. Those riding out the storm in their homes in New Orleans braced for the toughest test yet of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-orleans-levees-got-145-billion-upgrade-will-they-hold-2021-08-30" target="_blank"><strong>major upgrades to a levee system</strong></a> constructed following devastating floods in 2005 from Katrina, a hurricane that claimed some 1,800 lives.</p>



<p>"I almost found myself in a panic attack when news announced this was the anniversary of Katrina," said Janet Rucker, a lifelong New Orleans resident who took shelter in a downtown hotel with her dog, Deuce. "This is just not good for our nerves and our psyche."</p>



<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers said the newly reinforced New Orleans levees were expected to hold, though they said they said the flood walls could be overtopped in some places.</p>



<p>Hundreds of miles of new levees were built around New Orleans after flooding from Katrina inundated much of the low-lying city, especially historically Black neighborhoods.</p>



<p>Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - was reported to be exceeding predicted levels of 6 feet (1.8 m) along parts of the coast. Videos posted on social media showed storm surge flooding had transformed sections of Highway 90 along the Louisiana and Mississippi coast into a choppy river.</p>



<p>"We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees," said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish, one of the most vulnerable areas along the Gulf Coast.</p>



<p>The parish later issued an alert on Facebook urging residents of one area to seek higher ground after reports of an overtopped levee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>The system for protecting EU businesses from dumped and subsidised imports continued to function well in 2020 thanks to the EU's robust and innovative ways of using trade defence instruments (TDI), despite the practical challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is part of the European Commission's new trade strategy, whereby the EU takes a more assertive stance in defending its interests against unfair trade practices.</em></strong></p>



<p>Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said: “The EU needs effective tools to defend ourselves when we face unfair trade practices. This is a key pillar of our new strategy for an open, sustainable and assertive trade policy. We have continued to use our trade defence instruments effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic, improved their monitoring and enforcement, and tackled new ways of giving subsidies by third countries.  We will not tolerate the misuse of trade defence instruments by our trading partners and we will continue to support our exporters caught up in such cases. It is crucial that our companies and their workers can continue to rely on robust trade defence instruments that protect them against unfair trade practices.”</p>



<p>At the end of 2020, the EU had 150 trade defence measures in force, in line with previous years' activity levels with an increase in the number of cases lodged towards the end of 2020. In addition, for the first time, the Commission addressed a new type of subsidy given by third countries in the form of cross-border financial support that was a serious challenge for EU companies.</p>



<p>The following are the main trade-defence highlights of 2020:</p>



<p><strong>Continued high level of EU trade defence activity</strong></p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission had to swiftly introduce temporary changes to its work practices, especially concerning on-the-spot verification visits. This allowed the Commission to continue applying the instruments at the highest standards without a drop in the levels of activity. At the end of 2020, the 150 trade defence measures that the EU had in place – 10 more than at the end of 2019 – included 128 anti-dumping, 19 anti-subsidy and 3 safeguard measures.</p>



<p>In 2020, the Commission launched:</p>



<ul><li>15 investigations, compared to 16 in 2019, and imposed 17 provisional and definitive measures, compared to 15 in 2019;</li><li>28 reviews, compared to 23 the previous year.</li></ul>



<p>The highest number of EU trade defence measures concerns imports from:</p>



<ul><li>China (99 measures);</li><li>Russia (Nine measures);</li><li>India (Seven measures), and;</li><li>The United States (Six measures).</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tackling new types of subsidies</strong></p>



<p>In 2020, the Commission strengthened its action against subsidies granted by third countries. In particular, the Commission imposed countervailing duties on cross-border financial support given by China to Chinese-owned companies manufacturing glass fibre fabrics and continuous filament glass fibre products based in Egypt for export to the EU.</p>



<p>This means that, for the first time, the Commission addressed cross-border subsidies given by a country to enterprises located in another country for exports to the EU.</p>



<p><strong>Support to, and defence of, EU exporters facing trade defence investigations in export markets</strong></p>



<p>The importance of monitoring trade defence action taken by third countries was again evident in 2020. The number of trade defence measures in force by third countries affecting EU exporters reached its highest level since the Commission started this monitoring activity, with 178 measures in place. In addition, the number of cases initiated also increased in 2020, with 43 compared to 37 the previous year.</p>



<p>The report outlines the Commission's activities to ensure that WTO rules are correctly applied and procedural errors and legal inconsistencies are addressed in order to avoid any misuse of trade defence instruments by third countries. The Commission's interventions yielded success in some cases where measures were not ultimately imposed, affecting important EU export products such as ceramic tiles and fertilisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Strong focus on monitoring and enforcement</strong></p>



<p>There was a renewed focus on the monitoring of measures in place in 2020, including changes to surveillance practices to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the trade defence instruments. This also involved customs authorities, EU industry, and in certain instances, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Continuing its efforts to address instances where exporters tried to avoid measures, the Commission initiated three anti-circumvention investigations in 2020 and completed five such investigations during the year, where measures were extended in four cases to also address imports from third countries where transhipment was found to have taken place.</p>



<p>The report also recalls the findings of the European Court of Auditors from July 2020, which confirmed the successful enforcement of the EU's trade defence instruments by the Commission. The report made a number of recommendations to further strengthen the Commission's response to the challenges posed by unfairly traded imports that the Commission has started to implement in 2020, such as improving monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chairwoman of Buendnis 90/Die Gruenen Annalena Baerbock, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Armin Laschet and German Finance Minister and Social Democratic Party candidate Olaf Scholz wait for the start of a televised debate of the candidates to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor in Berlin, Germany, 29 August, 2021. Michael Kappeler/Pool via REUTERS</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The conservative candidate to succeed German Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to revive his campaign in a heated debate with his two main rivals on Sunday, according to a snap poll, as surveys show his party falling behind the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD),</em></strong> <strong>write Alexander Ratz, Paul Carrel, Maria Sheahan and <a>Emma Thomasson</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Armin Laschet, the leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), attacked the SPD's chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz, for not ruling out a coalition with the far-left Linke party and sought to strike a chord with voters as the CDU frets about its ratings.</p>



<p>But a snap survey of voters by pollster Forsa after the debate showed 36% believed Scholz won, ahead of 30% for Greens candidate Annalena Baerbock and 25% for Laschet.</p>



<p>"I have felt headwinds now and again, as I do now," a combative Laschet said in his closing remarks.</p>



<p>"But aren't we all feeling the winds of change blowing us in the face? At times like these, we need steadfastness, dependability and an internal compass. That is what I offer."</p>



<p>Germany goes to the polls on 26 September when Merkel steps down as chancellor after 16 years in office and four straight national election victories. Merkel's imminent departure has weakened support for her conservative alliance.</p>



<p>For much of the debate, Laschet traded barbs with Baerbock, who accused the CDU and SPD of doing too little to fight climate change, especially given devastating floods this summer.</p>



<p>"You obviously don't have a plan," Baerbock said of the other two, pledging to install solar panels on every roof and ban the sale of combustion engine vehicles from 2030.</p>



<p>Laschet, who has been under fire since he was caught on camera laughing during a visit last month to a town hit by floods, said Baerbock's policies would hurt German industry.</p>



<p>"You shackle industry and then tell them to run faster," he said. He added later: "I don't know whether citizens understood everything there with the programmes that Mrs. Baerbock has just described."</p>



<p>Scholz, who is the most popular of the candidates in polls, kept calm as the exchange became heated, focusing on financial topics such as taxes and pensions. He promised "a society that values respect. Respect for everyone."</p>



<p>"And that is why we need better pay, a higher minimum wage, and of course also stable pensions," he said, adding: "We have to stop man-made climate change and ensure that we still have good jobs in 10, 20 and 30 years."</p>



<p>Support for the SPD rose 2 points from last week to 24%, their highest result in four years, according to an INSA poll conducted for newspaper Bild am Sonntag. The conservatives slipped a point to 21%, their lowest ever polled by INSA.</p>



<p>It was the second survey in the past week that has put the SPD ahead. Support for Merkel's Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been falling in recent weeks.</p>



<p>In a hypothetical direct vote for chancellor, the INSA poll showed that Scholz would take 31% of the vote, compared with 10% for Laschet and 14% for Baerbock.</p>



<p>Despite the SPD's lead in the polls, they would still need to team up with two other parties to govern.</p>

<p>More than 7,000 people, some holding crosses, rallied outside the Greek parliament to protest against the inoculations. Similar protests in Athens last month also saw violence.</p>



<p>About 5.7 million people out of a total population of 11 million have been fully vaccinated, and polls have shown that most Greeks favour mandatory vaccination for certain groups such as health-care workers and nursing home staff.</p>



<p>However, hundreds of Greek frontline workers protested on (26 August) Thursday against a plan to make inoculations mandatory for the care sector on 1 September.</p>



<p>Cases remain high in Greece, which has reported a total of 581,315 cases since the start of the pandemic last year and 13,636 deaths. There were 1,582 new daily cases on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong><em>France, Britain and Germany are working on a United Nations proposal aimed at establishing a safe zone in Kabul to allow safe passage for people trying to leave Afghanistan, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday (29 August),</em></strong> <strong>write Sarah White, Bertrand Boucey, Tangi Salaun, Michel Rose and Manuel Ausloos in Mosul, <a>Reuters.</a></strong></p>



<p>Macron, who said France had begun discussions with the Taliban to explore how further evacuations might proceed, said the resolution would be brought on Monday to an emergency UN Security Council meeting of veto-wielding members.</p>



<p>"There are some discussions to see how flights could be re-established," Macron said in a TV interview broadcast by France's TF1, adding that Qatar was also helping negotiations.</p>



<p>"What we have proposed, and what we plan to bring to the UN Security Council along with Britain and Germany is a solution that we have used before in other operations, which would involve creating a zone allowing people to arrive at that airport."</p>



<p>Asked whether he was optimistic it could be accepted by the Taliban, Macron said it was too early to reach any conclusions, but he said it was worth pursuing.</p>



<p>"It can mobilise the whole international community, and it also puts pressure on the Taliban," Macron said, adding they would have to show they were willing to respect humanitarian concerns. Discussions with the Taliban did not mean France would necessarily recognize Taliban rule officially, Macron added.</p>



<p>The Taliban will allow all foreign nationals and Afghan citizens with travel authorisation from another country to leave Afghanistan, according to a joint statement issued by Britain, the United States and other countries including France on Sunday. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-agrees-allow-afghans-leave-international-statement-says-2021-08-29/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>



<p>On a visit to Mosul in Iraq, Macron said he was hopeful the resolution would be welcomed favourably by other countries.</p>



<p>"I cannot see who could oppose enabling the safety of humanitarian operations," Macron told reporters.</p>



<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is convening a meeting on Afghanistan with the U.N. envoys for Britain, France, the United States, China and Russia - the Security Council's permanent, veto-wielding members.</p>



<p>Macron said on Saturday that France was holding preliminary discussions with the Taliban about the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and the possible evacuation of more people.<strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-says-france-will-stay-iraq-whatever-us-decides-do-2021-08-28/">R</a></strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-says-france-will-stay-iraq-whatever-us-decides-do-2021-08-28/"><strong>ead more.</strong></a></p>



<p>US military forces, which have guarded the airport in Kabul, are due to withdraw by a Tuesday deadline set by President Joe Biden. France is among countries that have also ended evacuations from Kabul airport, including for its diplomatic staff, who are now in France.</p>
