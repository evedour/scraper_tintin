					<description><![CDATA[It's the first such declaration since communist times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The Polish government aims to introduce a state of emergency on the border with Belarus to stem migrants crossing illegally, Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the first such measure since the 1981 declaration of martial law under communist rule; past governments avoided declaring a state of emergency for natural disasters and even during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>The migrants, many of whom say they want to seek asylum in Poland, are part of a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-belarus-border-migration-hotspot-lithuania-poland-latvia-alexander-lukashenko/">wider effort</a> by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to fly people from the Middle East and send them across borders with Lithuania, Latvia and Poland as a way of exerting pressure on the EU.</p>



<p>&#8220;The situation on the border with Belarus is a crisis, it&#8217;s very tense, because Lukashenko&#8217;s regime is transporting people mainly from Iraq to the territory of Belarus and is then shoving these people on to the territory of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia to destabilize our countries,&#8221; Morawiecki <a href="https://www.onet.pl/informacje/onetwiadomosci/stan-wyjatkowy-w-czesci-woj-podlaskiego-i-lubelskiego-jest-wniosek/fpcr4w0,79cfc278" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>



<p>Warsaw registered more than 3,000 attempts at illegal crossings in August. In response, the government sent troops to back up border guards and is building a barbed-wire fence along the heavily forested frontier. </p>



<p>The highest profile issue is a group of 32 people <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/afghanistan-refugees-europe-poland-belarus-migration-crisis/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/afghanistan-refugees-europe-poland-belarus-migration-crisis/">stuck</a> on the border in Usnarz Górny — with the Poles refusing to let them enter and Belarusians not letting them back into Belarus. Human rights activists in the area say they lack access to food, water and shelter, and say Polish authorities are not accepting asylum requests from the migrants.</p>



<p>The migrants have attracted huge media attention, as well as the presence of opposition politicians and human rights campaigners, 13 of whom were arrested after trying to tear down the fence. Poland has also come under pressure from the European Court of Human Rights to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-court-human-rights-latvia-poland-iraq-afghanistan-migrants-belarus-border/">provide</a> migrants with food, water and temporary shelter.</p>



<p>Ylva Johansson, the migration commissioner, <a href="https://twitter.com/ylvajohansson/status/1431183443669434372" target="_blank">said</a> last week that the &#8220;area between the Poland and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Belarus?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank">#Belarus</a> borders is not a migration issue, but part of the aggression of Lukashenko toward Poland, Lithuania and Latvia with the aim to destabilize the E.U.”</p>



<p>If approved, the state of emergency would cover 183 towns lying within about 3 kilometers of the border and would last for 30 days. The detailed list of new measures hasn’t been disclosed, but Poland&#8217;s Interior Minister Mariusz Kamiński said they will have little impact on local inhabitants, while imposing restrictions on outsiders.</p>



<p>&#8220;No trips, no happenings and demonstrations will be able to be organized along this border zone,&#8221; he said, adding that the police, army and border guards have to have effective tools to bring order to the area. </p>



<p>“If we let this group into our country, in an illegal way, we will end up not with one Usnarz but with many,” Kamiński said, calling the effort to tear down the border fence &#8220;scandalous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Morawiecki said Lithuania and Latvia have brought in similar measures.</p>



<p>The government will ask President Andrzej Duda to introduce the state of emergency. The decision will later have to be approved by the parliament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That effort is already coming under fire in the deeply divided country, with The Left opposition party saying it will <a href="https://klub-lewica.org.pl/aktualnosci/1854-lewica-zlozy-dzis-wniosek-o-nadzwyczajne-posiedzenie-sejmu-na-ktorym-zlozy-wniosek-o-cofniecie-rozporzadzenia-prezydenta-dot-stanu-wyjatkowego" target="_blank">call</a> for an emergency session of parliament to reject the state of emergency.</p>



<p>Jan Grabiec, a spokesperson for Civic Platform, the largest opposition party, <a href="https://twitter.com/JanGrabiec/status/1432666494559789060" target="_blank">said</a> the state of emergency was not aimed at halting migrants and &#8220;it will only stop the Polish media from showing the chaos and helplessness of the government.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Alar Karis will take over from Kersti Kaljulaid in October.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alar Karis was elected president of Estonia in the country&#8217;s parliament Tuesday, after an election in which he was the only candidate.</p>



<p>Karis, director of the Estonian National Museum, received 72 out of 101 votes, according to <a href="https://news.err.ee/1608321953/alar-karis-elected-president-of-estonia" target="_blank">local media</a>.</p>



<p>Karis, a former state auditor, ran as an independent candidate with the support of the two governing parties: the Estonian Reform Party and the Estonian Centre Party. No other candidates registered by a deadline of late Saturday. </p>



<p>In a first round of voting Monday, Karis failed to win enough support, falling five votes short of the 68 votes needed. He held talks with opposition parties before the second round.</p>



<p>Kersti Kaljulaid’s five-year term as president expires on October 10.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The US president and his Democratic allies are looking to return their focus to their legislative agenda and the COVID-19 pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The United States officially ended its 20-year war in Afghanistan. Now, President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats are racing to put the conflict’s tumultuous exit behind them.</p>



<p>Consumed with combating the most intensive crisis of Biden’s presidency over the last few weeks, White House officials are plotting a way forward that hinges tactically on Biden’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and passage of his sweeping economic agenda on Capitol Hill.</p>



<p>The cold political calculation is based on a belief inside the White House that Americans by and large will ultimately process the withdrawal from Afghanistan as a necessary, albeit difficult, act, even if they harbor lingering doubts about its execution.</p>



<p>“The path forward for them in the fall remains Covid and infrastructure,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a former communications director in the Obama White House who is close to the Biden administration. “The most important facts about Afghanistan remain that he got the U.S. out, in terms of what the public cares about.”</p>



<p>Biden pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by his self-imposed deadline, ensuring that a fifth president wouldn’t inherit what was a painful, two-decade chapter in our nation’s history. But the deaths of 13 U.S. service members in a terrorist attack last week, part of a chaotic withdrawal that left between 100 and 200 Americans behind, was a black mark for Biden and a gut punch to a White House that has prided itself on competence and foreign policy expertise.</p>



<p>Biden said in a statement Monday night that “it was the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs and of all of our commanders on the ground to end our airlift mission as planned,” but plans to discuss the decision in more detail in a speech Tuesday afternoon.</p>



<p>Democrats have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/democrat-senate-panels-biden-afghanistan-505665" target="_blank">voiced their frustrations</a> with the administration in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/RepSusanWild/status/1431017500238651393?s=20" target="_blank">increasingly blunt terms</a> and fretted about the political repercussions from the end of the war. For the first time in the Biden administration, they are putting distance between themselves and the president.</p>



<p>Biden’s&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorability has dropped&nbsp;</a>in recent polls,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/16/afghanistan-politics-biden-fallout-505339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trend that began&nbsp;</a>just before the Taliban took over Kabul. But sources in the administration, outside allies, and some Democrats on Capitol Hill described that fall as temporary and contend the president’s ability to quickly shepherd his infrastructure and social spending plans through Congress will ultimately determine Democrats’ political viability.</p>



<p>Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) said some of the anger among his Democratic colleagues at the president “may be overplayed.” Base Democratic voters he’s talked to aren’t upset, the congressman said. Instead, the issue “holding the attention of mothers and fathers right now,” he said, is whether their children will be safe in school as Covid-19 cases rise.</p>



<p>The voters he’s talked to back home, including steel workers, are clamoring for infrastructure funding and child care aid, said Cleaver. After seeing some of the headlines about the recent revolt of moderate House Democrats over the sequencing of Biden’s agenda, Cleaver said some have asked why Democratic lawmakers won’t “get out of the way if you can&#8217;t help the president.”</p>



<p>In the short-term, Biden aides and allies have rallied around new messaging that embraces the many quagmires the president finds himself in: No easy issues land on the desk of the president, they say, and navigating the current crises was something Biden ran on and has been doing since his first day in office. They view the shift not as a strategic pivot but as a natural offshoot of the current news cycle.</p>



<p>With U.S. forces now out of Afghanistan, much of the coverage coming out of the weekend has focused on the hurricane battering Louisiana and Mississippi. Millions of children are starting school or are heading back to class soon, amid renewed controversy over mask mandates. The upcoming holiday weekend, meanwhile, will be followed by the return of Congress, and renewed attention on Biden’s domestic agenda, which is where his aides hope to see new successes.</p>



<p>But passing Biden’s infrastructure and $3.5 trillion social spending packages in the next month will be far from a cakewalk. One senior House Democratic source said there is concern among some lawmakers that “bad news on multiple fronts” for the White House could “complicate the legislative strategy.”</p>



<p>And moderate Democrats have made clear they want to see the size of Biden’s second economic package — which includes reforming prescription drug prices and funding child and elder care, among other major priorities — shrink.</p>



<p>“This is a very delicate moment,” said Cleaver. “People are wondering how are the Democrats going to handle this authority we gave them?”</p>



<p>On top of the Afghanistan exit and upcoming legislative battles, the administration must still contend with a deadly Covid resurgence that’s had hospitalizations and deaths soaring across the country.</p>



<p>Despite the mounting challenges, there’s a belief in Bidenworld that time is on their side. Midterm campaigns are still a year from heating up, giving the president room to accelerate a vaccination campaign, allay concerns about inflation and message legislative wins — should they come to fruition.</p>



<p>Some aides and allies have gone further, bristling at attempts by the media and pundits to divine the White House’s political calculus from seemingly every moment.</p>



<p>“I would not be worried about week-to-week poll numbers,” Palmieri said. “You want to be on a trajectory where you know at the end of the year you&#8217;re making progress and how the American people view the job you’re doing,” Palmieri said. “They know that those remain the two most important metrics.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, voters will judge the administration on economic recovery, job creation and help for working families — as well as the president’s ability to get Covid under control — Biden’s chief pollster John Anzalone said.</p>



<p>“I think that if everyone just would step back and say, ‘Okay, let&#8217;s have this conversation. What is the conversation going to look a year from now?’” Anzalone said. “‘Biden Democrats’ are going to have this incredible narrative for the American people. I think that that is always tough to see when you have the fog of a crisis, I get it. But we are now a party and a presidency that has something to actually run on — that’s proactively doing things.”</p>



<p>There’s undoubtedly a risk to that strategy should the bloody and chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal fail to fade from the headlines. Republicans have blanketed social media questioning Biden’s competency. And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/democrat-senate-panels-biden-afghanistan-505665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Democratic-led congressional committees</a>&nbsp;have vowed to investigate “failures” that led to a deadly exit. What’s more, Biden still must contend with the resettlement of thousands of Afghan refugees, an issue that’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/30/biden-afghanistan-refugee-backlash-507399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already stirring&nbsp;</a>Republican pushback at home.</p>



<p>“I have traveled my district, and I&#8217;ve spent time with veterans and there&#8217;s a lot of raw emotion there,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents Laredo, home to one of the 13 Marines killed in the Kabul attack. As Cuellar talks to his constituents, he said he tries to offer the full history of the war and other presidents’ involvement, including former President Donald Trump’s negotiations with the Taliban that set the exit in motion. Still, Cuellar fears Biden is “losing independents, and the independents are the ones that help us win races.”</p>



<p>“Sometimes I question who&#8217;s advising the president,” said Cuellar. “Am I happy with the ending? Absolutely not. Do we have a lot of questions? Absolutely, yes. Should somebody resign? I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s find out what happened.”</p>



<p>To the extent that Biden is considered damaged goods at the moment, it hasn’t changed the White House’s political strategy: Even their ambitious August plans to build support for his economic agenda didn’t involve sending Biden on the road.</p>



<p>For now, the White House is banking on the public eventually coming to the conclusion the president did: that the need to focus on the problems at home was worth ending a war that seemed, at times, impossible to end.</p>



<p>“The American people understand that there comes a point that you have to say enough is enough. Biden is the first president to finally do that,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told POLITICO shortly before the suicide bombing that killed 13 service members. “And so I appreciate what he has done — what he did after 20 years of war.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The initial expectation was that this goal would be reached in late September.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The EU can now boast that 70 percent of adults are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. </p>



<p>The Commission&#8217;s goal to vaccinate 70 percent of adults by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; was often a moving target, as the executive first implied this could be the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccine-europe-hit-commission-target-rollout-5-times-faster/">end of September</a>. As vaccine supplies ramped up, EU officials said the bloc could meet this goal in July. </p>



<p>At the end of July, the Commission <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1782990">announced</a> that the EU had vaccinated 70 percent of adults —&nbsp;but only with one dose, a move that prompted eye-rolls from some.  </p>



<p>Nevertheless, on Tuesday the bloc officially met this goal, according to the EU&#8217;s calculation.</p>



<p>In a video statement, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called it a &#8220;great achievement&#8221; that showed &#8220;what we can do when we work together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We must go further!&#8221; she <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1432638914142089220" target="_blank">tweeted</a>. &#8220;We need more Europeans to vaccinate. And we need to help the rest of the world vaccinate, too.&#8221; </p>



<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control&nbsp;(ECDC)&#8217;s <a href="https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab" target="_blank">tracker</a>, which includes data up to August 27, still says only 67.4 percent of adults are fully vaccinated. </p>



<p>Despite reaching this milestone, experts say that the vaccination rate will have to be much higher —&nbsp;around 80 percent and 90 percent — and include teens due to the more transmissible Delta variant. </p>



<p>There are also discrepancies between EU countries. Bulgaria and Romania are lagging far behind, having around 20 percent and 32 percent of adults fully vaccinated, respectively. </p>



<p>&#8220;We need to be one step ahead,&#8221; Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides wrote in a statement. &#8220;We need to urgently address the worrying gap in vaccination rates between our Member States, and be ready to deploy booster vaccines if the scientific evidence shows this is the way forward.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some countries are also planning to administer booster shots, despite a World Health Organization call to halt third shots until 10 percent of all countries have been vaccinated.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Thousands of people are being used as human ammunition in Lukashenko’s hybrid war against Europe.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Marija Golubeva is the Latvian interior minister.</em></p>



<p>Since July, the surge in illegal migration from Belarus to Latvia, Lithuania and Poland has seen thousands of migrants stranded on the EU’s borders. With the situation reaching a crisis point, just last week the prime ministers of all three countries, along with their Estonian counterpart, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mk.gov.lv/en/article/statement-prime-ministers-ingrida-simonyte-lithuania-arturs-krisjanis-karins-latvia-kaja-kallas-estonia-and-mateusz-morawiecki-poland-hybrid-attack-our-borders-belarus" target="_blank">expressed grave concern</a> regarding the situation unfolding at their borders. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lured by promises of easy access to the EU and the chance to settle in countries such as Germany or Sweden, thousands of people from as far as Iraq boarded planes bound for Minsk, where they were escorted to the borders of these countries. However, it is increasingly clear that this situation is not simply being tolerated by Minsk but has been planned and systematically organized <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/lukashenko-s-revenge-how-belarus-is-funneling-refugees-into-the-eu-a-a3151fc2-9b3b-4812-a63a-298ea26f55b0" target="_blank">under the guidance of</a> Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lukashenko’s plan is simple: Overwhelm the reception and asylum systems of the EU with a new stream of irregular migration, and strain our capacity to react to genuine crises. This is nothing other than a form of hybrid warfare, exploiting the gray area between peace, crisis and war. And the situation only continues to escalate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be allowed to continue. The EU must effectively protect its external borders and prevent any illegal border crossing. By closely following the migratory and security situation, the EU should develop new tools to deter and act against attempts to instrumentalize illegal migration for political purposes, both now and in the future.</p>



<p>Many countries have faced the threat of a hybrid war before — including Georgia, Ukraine, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and, of course, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stratcomcoe.org/publications/hybrid-threats-a-strategic-communications-perspective/79" target="_blank">Latvia</a>. What is new is the method being used to make this threat real: the weaponization of migration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NATO defines a hybrid threat as one “that combines conventional, irregular and asymmetric activities in time and space.” Hybrid threats do not invoke a particular sequence of events. They are coordinated activities that target the weakest systemic points of democratic states and institutions, aiming to reach strategic objectives that will make their targets more vulnerable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important test for any country facing such a threat is its capacity to react rapidly. When it comes to migration, it is well known that EU member countries have limited possibilities to simply push or force back those who cross their borders illegally. And Belarus knew this as it organized and directed a stream of migrants toward the eastern border of the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the swift reaction by Latvia and Lithuania to declare a state of emergency in border areas was a necessary and bold step to guard the EU’s external border. The declaration is a clear message to both Belarus and potential irregular migrants that EU countries will not permit the illegal, uncontrolled crossing of their borders.</p>



<p>The hybrid threat also poses a risk to our societies more broadly. Governments that face such threats are put under great strain: It can become increasingly difficult to reach a political consensus, both at home and internationally, as hybrid threats lead to ambiguity and uncertainty and exploit the cracks of distrust in societies to deepen existing conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also facing an element of “information warfare,” another aspect of hybrid threats, as Belarusian media are attempting to portray Baltic countries and Poland as the real culprits — anything to sway public opinion from seeing the government of Belarus as the source of the conflict and shift focus toward the countries on the receiving end of this attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation on the Belarus border is becoming increasingly untenable. Prevented from returning to their countries of origin by Belarusian authorities, people brought near the Latvian-Belarusian border have been left without food, shelter or medical assistance. Latvia’s border guards are now providing these migrants with health monitoring, food and hygiene products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Border guards and officials in charge of Latvia’s external border will continue to act in accordance with the law and international treaties. But we also need Europe’s support: We must do everything to join our efforts to prevent undemocratic regimes in our neighborhood from targeting our external border and abusing our asylum policies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Europe is not just a geographic area; it is a union based on rights and values. To protect Europe means not only protecting its physical borders but also its values and the rule of law. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing the ruthlessness of the Lukashenko regime, the EU must also be ready for a possible escalation of the situation in the near future. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The United States’ evacuation mission in Afghanistan has come to an end, leaving behind Americans and thousands of Afghan allies as the U.S. declared the end of the 20-year war not long after the clock struck midnight in Kabul.</p>



<p>The last C-17 departed from Hamid Karzai International airport on Monday, said Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, meeting U.S. President Joe Biden’s August 31 deadline.</p>



<p>“Tonight&#8217;s withdrawal signifies both the end of the military component of the evacuation but also the end of the nearly 20-year mission that began in Afghanistan shortly after September 11, 2001,” McKenzie said.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a mission that brought Osama bin Laden to a just end, along with many of his al-Qaeda co-conspirators. And it was not a cheap mission. The cost was 2,461 U.S. service members and civilians killed and more than 20,000 who were injured.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The French president stuck his neck out, banking that the public would support his plan. And so far, it’s been a success.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>PARIS — It has been a nail-biting summer for officials at the top of the French government. Would Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s controversial decision to force people to carry a vaccine passport if they wanted to visit everywhere from a bar to a museum backfire and fuel the country&#8217;s protest movement?</p>



<p>Each week, officials at the Elysée and in the prime minister’s office anxiously waited for the figures on the size of the protests to roll in. Now, as the country approaches its target of giving <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/societe/sante/covid-19-jean-michel-blanquer-presente-la-feuille-de-route-pour-la-rentree-scolaire-suivez-notre-direct-26-08-2021-75B4KFSXMJBMPEI5ZI4O2XTECU.php" target="_blank">50 million people at least one jab</a> by the end of August, many of those officials are heaving a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>“We are patting ourselves on the back, though we know we have not yet reached results that are completely satisfactory,” said one government adviser. &#8220;Macron took a firm decision, and the French gave him their vote of confidence. The protests have remained marginal.”</p>



<p>Macron’s decision to bring in the vaccine passport on the eve of the summer holidays was a jaw-dropper.</p>



<p>The COVID immunity pass — a digital or paper certificate that contains proof of vaccination, of immunity or of a negative test — is needed to get into cafés, bars, restaurants, hospitals, museums, galleries, and on trains, planes and coaches. On Monday, the scheme <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/pres-de-2-millions-de-salaries-soumis-au-passe-sanitaire-une-complication-de-plus-pour-les-entreprises-20210829" target="_blank">was extended to the employees of all venues</a> that are open to the public.</p>



<p>Although there was some watering down of the plans at first —&nbsp;waiters were told they would not have to check IDs as well as vaccine certificates, and most shopping malls would be exempt — the government held fast.</p>



<p>A lot of people weren&#8217;t happy. Every week, protesters take to the streets of Paris, Marseille and other cities, for a variety of reasons. Some are anti-vax, others claim to be pro-liberty and then there are those who are just fed up with Macron. But the figures have not taken off. Last weekend, around 160,000 people took to the streets, down from 175,000 the previous week and 215,000 in mid-August, according to figures from the interior ministry.</p>



<p>Early comparisons with the Yellow Jackets movement that shook the president in 2018 and 2019 have proven wide of the mark. Macron’s rivals also failed to capitalize on discontent, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen reluctant to upset her voters, who are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/playbook-paris/politico-playbook-paris-macron-pedalo-pedago-le-rn-passe-son-tour-un-rapport-brulant/">split over the pass,</a> and the Socialists clumsily backing mandatory jabs but not the pass. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, millions have headed to vaccination centers. According to the French prime minister’s office, 12 million people have been vaccinated since Macron announced the introduction of the coronavirus passport.</p>



<h3>&#8216;The best moment of his handling of the crisis&#8217;</h3>



<p>It’s the view of many doctors that the coronavirus passport flattened the curve of the pandemic this summer, just as France was facing a steep third wave fueled by the more contagious Delta variant and the lifting of lockdown measures. </p>



<p>“It saved tens of thousands of lives,” said Martin Blachier, a public health consultant. “The French were reluctant [to get the jab] and he crafted a message that was heard. It was the best moment of his handling of the crisis, maybe even of his tenure.”</p>



<p>The figures so far are looking promising. Some 83 percent of the French population over the age of 12 have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to France’s <a href="https://covidtracker.fr/vaccintracker/" target="_blank">COVID tracker</a>. The number of daily cases has dropped to under 14,000, after peaking at about 24,000 in mid-August. The number of patients in intensive care increased in August but appears to be leveling off at under 3,000.</p>



<p>An uptick in the epidemic is expected with the return of students and pupils to classrooms in September, but “the risk of a cataclysm has been avoided,” said Blachier. According to him, if the vaccination rate had remained where it was before the summer — when less than 50 percent of the population had received a first dose — there would have been a lot more admissions into hospitals, which would have meant overstretched wards and more deaths.</p>



<p>But others are not as enthusiastic about the pass.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to know what impact it had,” said Nicolas Bruder, head of an intensive care unit at the Timone hospital in Marseille. “If you look at the map of France, cases have increased where there have been big gatherings in touristic areas [despite the pass].”</p>



<p>But in his hospital, the introduction of the pass —&nbsp;as well as the announcement that the jab would be mandatory for health workers —&nbsp;led to a leap in vaccination rates. More than 70 percent of his staff are vaccinated, compared to over 50 percent in June.</p>



<p>And that’s the point. Proponents say the health pass has worked because people reacted by getting vaccinated, which protects them from developing serious conditions even if they do get the virus.</p>



<p>“The pass creates a false sense of security because it throws together people who are vaccinated, and therefore can transmit the disease, and people who have been tested negative,” said Blachier. “If people had reacted by getting tested every couple of days, the pass would have had the opposite effect, accelerating the epidemic, and leading to a lot more deaths.”</p>



<p>But they didn’t. “It was a political move, a means to an end. Some wanted to introduce mandatory jabs, but the question was how do we get there,” said the government adviser.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Commission says it will withhold certain funds until the country makes systemic changes requested in an audit involving PM Andrej Babiš.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Commission is ratcheting up its conflict-of-interest fight with the Czech Republic, threatening to withhold payments involving companies held by trust funds.  </p>



<p>The move comes after long-standing concerns that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš may have inappropriately benefited from such arrangements led Brussels to issue recommendations for systemic changes in how the country handles European funding. </p>



<p>In 2017, Babiš placed his massive Agrofert agriculture and chemical conglomerate in two trust funds. But in a 2019 audit, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/czech-prime-minister-andrej-babis-european-commission-audit-agrofert-conflict-of-interests/">made public earlier this year</a>, the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/reports/2021/final-report-on-the-audit-of-the-functioning-of-the-management-and-control-systems-in-place-to-avoid-conflict-of-interest-in-czechia" target="_blank">found</a> the prime minister still had &#8220;direct&#8221; and &#8220;indirect&#8221; influence over those trust funds. As a result, it said, &#8220;all grants&#8221; awarded to Agrofert since February 2017 violated a conflict-of-interest law.</p>



<p>And while the Czech authorities ultimately did not request any EU money in connection to the activities mentioned in the audit, the issue has sparked a broader push for respecting conflict-of-interest rules. </p>



<p>Now, the Commission has sent Prague a letter advising local authorities running EU-funded regional development and social programs not to seek reimbursement for payments to any trust fund-controlled companies in general. The Commission said it won&#8217;t make payments in these cases.</p>



<p>The letter, sent last week, urged Prague to adopt the recommendations from the audit, which advised that the Czech Republic &#8220;improve the management and control systems in place&#8221; to &#8220;ensure that no further grants are awarded&#8221; in breach of conflict-of-interest rules. </p>



<p>The Commission, a spokesperson confirmed Monday, expects &#8220;the Czech authorities to implement all the recommendations that were put forward in the audit report.&#8221; </p>



<p>If not, the consequences could be financial. </p>



<p>The Commission &#8220;will interrupt any future payment claims in respect of such companies pending the implementation of system improvements to address this risk,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>Babiš, who has long rejected any allegation of wrongdoing, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>In June, the European Parliament called in a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0282_EN.html" target="_blank">resolution</a> for &#8220;ensuring that the business entities under Prime Minister Babiš’s control cease to receive any funding from EU funds.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Further disbursement of funds, either from the EU or Czech national budget, to the companies ultimately controlled by Prime Minister Babiš or members of the Czech Government must be halted until the cases of conflict of interest are fully resolved,&#8221; MEPs said. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The opium trade is a vital chunk of gross domestic product, with poppy farming sustaining lives and livelihoods across most provinces. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>LONDON — The Taliban have pledged to kick the habit in Afghanistan and end its reliance on the illegal drugs trade.&nbsp;But success — assuming the unscrupulous Islamists are true to their word — could be down to the nations now struggling to evacuate their citizens from a Taliban-ruled nightmare.</p>



<p>Ending the Afghan reliance on drug income will be no mean feat. The opium trade is a vital chunk of gross domestic product, with poppy farming sustaining lives and livelihoods across most provinces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Britain and its Western allies, it is a challenge that weighs the benefits of stopping a flood of illegal drugs coming into their own countries with the problems of dealing with a potentially brutal de facto government with an appalling track record on human rights. What&#8217;s more, failure to effectively stem the flow of drugs could see countries such as China, Russia and Iran stepping in.</p>



<p>In 2020, Afghan farmers produced some 2,300 tons of opium, according to <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/crop-monitoring/Afghanistan/20210503_Executive_summary_Opium_Survey_2020_SMALL.pdf" target="_blank">United Nations estimates</a>. It accounts for <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2010/1.2_The_global_heroin_market.pdf" target="_blank">more than 90 percent</a> of illicit global supply and <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/4185/documents/43162/default/" target="_blank">95 percent of the U.K. market</a>. Despite the Western presence that ended this month, and despite dropping prices, latest estimates show production at record levels. Meanwhile, bigger profit margins on crystal meth are <a href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/ad-hoc-publication/emerging-evidence-of-afghanistans-role-as-a-producer-and-supplier-of-ephedrine-and-methamphetamine_en" target="_blank">driving an Afghan boom</a> in the cultivation of its origin ephedra plant too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first time the Taliban and Western governments have faced this conundrum. The Taliban did manage to crack down on drug production between 2000 and 2001, during their previous reign — reducing the opium harvest by more than 90 percent, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/pdf/publications/report_2001-10-16_1.pdf" target="_blank">according to a U.N. survey</a>. But it came with stark consequences for the Islamist group’s grip on power.</p>



<p>For starters, hopes that the move would usher in diplomatic recognition from global nations came to nothing when the U.N. imposed fresh sanctions over the Taliban&#8217;s protection of Osama bin Laden after 9/11.</p>



<p>Even more problematic for the Taliban, removing the livelihoods of countless farmers slashed their domestic backing. The militants faced a peasant revolt, and a subsequent lack of support when Western allies invaded in 2001, ousted them from control.</p>



<p>Some argue the Taliban fell in 2001 because the crackdown on drugs hit their own tax revenues. But Jonathan Goodhand, a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies, said that was misguided. “It was the politics around it,” he explained. “It was the growing stress and pressure it created amongst the peasantry.”</p>



<p>This time, the Islamists appear to have learned their lesson. “Afghanistan will not be a country of cultivation of opium anymore,” said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid at his first press conference after the group took control of Kabul. But his pledge came with a kicker: “The international community needs to help us.”</p>



<p>Translation: Foreign investment and lots of it. </p>



<h3>Damned if you dope</h3>



<p>The Taliban themselves do not rely on opium income to operate, although it is a supplement to their revenue. The extent of Taliban involvement in the drugs trade is contested, but <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/08/22/learned-taliban-will-fund-decades-studying-afghanistans-opium/" target="_blank">according to research</a>, the group relies more on taxes from legal trading than those from the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, funds from Western governments will be needed to help impoverished Afghan communities wean off the drug as a reliable source of income.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The need might never have been more urgent. The current chaos in the nation is a recipe for a further boom in the drugs trade, since an unstable political situation is prime breeding ground for black markets to fester.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cracking down on the drugs trade “is not going to be a priority for anyone” in the near future, Goodhand argued. “So it’s going to grow.”</p>



<p>The possibility has led to fears that even more heroin could end up surging across Europe, causing prices of the dangerous drug to plunge and further exacerbating the health spending crisis in the U.K. </p>



<p>“That would be the most unintended of a long list of unintended consequences arising from this disastrous decision [to withdraw from Afghanistan],” said Jeremy Hunt, former Cabinet minister and chair of the House of Commons health committee.</p>



<p>A possible drug import surge will be even harder to deal with after Brexit, because the U.K. gave up its direct access to EU crime data resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Opium cultivation in Afghanistan [has] been on an upward trajectory and the likely destabilization of the country in the coming months and years following the withdrawal of Western forces is likely to impact on production levels,” a National Crime Agency spokesperson said. “Through our international liaison network, we will continue to work with partners in the region to tackle serious and organized crime threats, including the class A drugs trade.”</p>



<h3>Getting clean</h3>



<p>Previous international attempts at counternarcotics in Afghanistan failed. Western nations tried the destruction of opium crops and processing labs, but it made little impact. Britain also attempted to help recultivate land, but via a structure that helped wealthier landowners rather than the farmers working for them, while funds were never reliable enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia Buxton, professor in drugs policy at the University of Manchester, said past efforts to curb drug production had been a “catastrophic failure,” adding: “We&#8217;ve got a lot of experience in doing development in drugs economies badly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aid already accounts for a big part of the Afghan income, with the U.K. among nations and organizations pledging to boost aid spending in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover — although the cash from Britain is reducing overall after across-the-board aid cuts were agreed last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scale of change needed to transform the Afghan economy away from narcotics and towards other agriculture or industries is so vast that only a nationwide aid plan including land reform and massive infrastructure building will do, according to observers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The big lesson we learned from U.K. development projects in Afghanistan is that you can&#8217;t treat the opium economy in isolation,” said Buxton. &#8220;It has to be a national economic recovery strategy.” She said attempting to counter the opium trade via aid agencies without dealing with the Taliban as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan could “cause more harm than good.”</p>



<p>Downing Street has so far said aid will be given via humanitarian organizations and not to the Taliban unless the group is willing to protect human rights and crack down on drugs and terror.</p>



<p>“If those huge funds are going to be unfrozen eventually for use by the government and people of Afghanistan, then what we’re saying is Afghanistan can’t lurch back into becoming a breeding ground of terror,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said following a G7 call last week. “Afghanistan can’t become a narco state, girls have to be educated up to the age of 18, and so on.”</p>



<h3>Drugs deals</h3>



<p>Pro-aid Conservatives accept that working with the Taliban will be inevitable, although they remain cautious. </p>



<p>Andrew Mitchell, a Conservative MP and former international development secretary, said dealing with the new “de facto government” was the only option to avoid losing 20 years of development gains. &#8220;The international community needs to approach the issue with the Taliban on a contractual basis,” he said. “It needs to be a carrot and stick approach.&#8221;</p>



<p>And there might be simpler — and therefore cheaper — routes to reform. Crispin Blunt, another Conservative former minister and current chair of a Westminster committee on drug policy reform, said Afghan farmers should be allowed to produce legal opium — maintaining valuable infrastructure and know-how.</p>



<p>“These poor buggers in Helmand aren’t allowed to grow it for the legal market,” he said, noting that the U.K. helped criminalize Afghan growers and producers while growing its own legal opium for medical use. But Buxton argued legal poppy cultivation wouldn’t be financially sustainable for farmers under current land ownership structures. </p>



<p>Western nations are not the only ones weighing this dilemma.</p>



<p>Afghanistan’s drug problem is also a concern for China. Responding to the Taliban’s vow to crack down on the drug trade, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this month: “The Taliban’s spokespeople mentioned &#8230; that Afghanistan would cease to be a hub for growing opium and trading drugs — this is indicative of a right way forward.”</p>



<p>“The key game-changer will be China,” said Goodhand, noting that the economic giant wants to connect its “Belt and Road” trade plan through the Afghan Wakhan Corridor. “You could see that being a level of investment which would dwarf anything the West would be entertaining.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Conservative candidate for chancellor lays out more detailed climate proposals, promising 'innovation.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The conservative candidate to succeed Angela Merkel, Armin Laschet, sought to boost his green credentials on Monday and pledged to turn Germany into a &#8220;climate-neutral industrial nation&#8221; by 2045.</p>



<p>The green push is part of a larger effort to revive Laschet&#8217;s ailing election campaign,<strong> </strong>which includes proposals on digitalization, security, family and education policy, and strengthening Germany&#8217;s middle class to be rolled out in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>&#8220;On climate policy, we are banking on innovation, on market-based mechanisms,&#8221; Laschet said at a press conference in Berlin, where he also unveiled a policy paper titled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nwwnl7ifahow/4plmET0EH5AcvdDiv1pMIU/20e6010c8d2d75a0b2600b9c71399f6b/Beschluss_Ein_Turbo_f__r_die_Erneuerbaren.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;A turbo for renewables&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://www.cdu.de/artikel/turbo-fuer-erneuerbare-energien" target="_blank">an expert team</a> to tackle the green transition. </p>



<p>Laschet called his party&#8217;s approach on climate &#8220;more promising than the bans &#8230; [proposed by] the Social Democratic Party and the Greens,&#8221; which he said <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-election-2021-armin-laschet-green-targets-threaten-social-peace/" target="_blank">threaten to kill jobs</a> and cause social unrest.</p>



<p>The 10-page paper includes proposals to cut red tape for the installation of wind turbines and remove taxes for renewables and seeks to flesh out ideas put forward in the CDU/CSU alliance&#8217;s election program, which was criticized for lacking ambition on green targets. </p>



<p>Laschet&#8217;s comments come on the heels of a middling performance in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/brussels-playbook-eu-must-grow-up-afghanistan-on-the-agenda-defeated-by-belgian-weather/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=54c9e8306b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_30_03_02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-54c9e8306b-189693549" target="_blank">televised election debate</a> on Sunday. A post-debate poll showed viewers judged his performance to be poorer than his opponents, the Social Democrats&#8217; candidate Olaf Scholz and the Greens&#8217; Annalena Baerbock. </p>



<p>According to POLITICO&#8217;s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/">Poll of Polls</a>, the CDU/CSU is neck-and-neck with Scholz&#8217;s SPD at 21 percent, while the Greens are polling at 18 percent. </p>
