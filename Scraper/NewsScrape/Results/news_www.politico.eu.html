					<description><![CDATA[Frost warns dispute could hold back 'new era' of cooperation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Failure to resolve a dispute over customs rules in the Irish Sea could damage U.K.-EU cooperation on global challenges for decades to come, the U.K.&#8217;s Brexit minister Lord Frost warned Saturday.</p>



<p>“I worry this process is capable of generating a sort of cold mistrust between us and the EU which could spread across the relationship,&#8221; Frost said in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/lord-frost-speech-at-british-irish-association-4-september-2021" target="_blank">speech</a>. &#8220;It’s holding back the potential for a new era of cooperation between like-minded states in a world which needs us to work together effectively.” </p>



<p>The U.K. and EU are trying to iron out differences over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, which applies EU rules to goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain. It&#8217;s designed to protect the EU&#8217;s single market and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>



<p>Since the protocol entered into force in January both sides have been mired in disagreement, with the U.K. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53724381" target="_blank">pushing</a> for far fewer customs checks. In what has been dubbed a &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commissioner-maros-sefcovic-do-everything-to-avoid-a-brexit-sausage-war/">sausage war</a>,&#8221; negotiators agreed not to apply rules on chilled meats until an <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1751151">already-extended deadline</a> of September 30 and talks are continuing.</p>



<p>This year Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1643154">launched</a> but then <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-uk-legal-actions-paused/">paused</a> legal action against London over its refusal to fully implement the agreement.</p>



<p>Lord Frost said that &#8220;for now&#8221; the British government would not trigger a suspension or &#8220;sweep all the existing arrangements away&#8221; but he warned that the disagreement could have very serious consequences if left unresolved. </p>



<p>“When one looks at the protocol and sets it against other international challenges that we face, one wonders what future generations would say of us if we were unable to make the small muscle movements needed to get this right,&#8221; he said at a British-Irish Association conference in Oxford.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have no interest at all in having a fractious and difficult relationship with the EU or its member states, and with Ireland above all. Quite the contrary,&#8221; Frost insisted.</p>



<p>Speaking at the same conference Friday, Irish Prime Minister <a href="https://merrionstreet.ie/en/news-room/news/speech_by_an_taoiseach_michel_martin_t_d_british-irish_association_oxford.171140.shortcut.html" target="_blank">Micheál Martin said</a> commitments made under the Brexit deal must be adhered to. &#8220;A positive and constructive future partnership is in everyone’s interest. But it will only be delivered if there is a relationship of trust, and a willingness to deliver on commitments entered into,&#8221; he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Global push for funds set for September 13.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The United Nations will hold an international conference to raise humanitarian funds for the Afghan people on September 13, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said Saturday. </p>



<p>The Taliban-controlled country &#8220;faces a looming humanitarian catastrophe,&#8221; Guterres said in a video posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1433920590839169028?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>The aim of the ministerial-level conference is &#8220;to advocate for more resources so lifesaving humanitarian operations can continue,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Guterres has <a href="https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1433003698091876352?s=20" target="_blank">said</a> that nearly half of Afghanistan&#8217;s roughly 40 million people need humanitarian support. An economic collapse is beckoning and serious <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/drought-leaves-afghans-hungry-economic-collapse-looms-un-2021-09-02/" target="_blank">drought</a> has restricted food supplies leading to fears of mass starvation.</p>



<p>&#8220;We need the international community to stand together and support the Afghan people,&#8221; Guterres said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We also appeal for full and unimpeded humanitarian access to make sure Afghans continue to get the essential services they need,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>EU foreign ministers on Friday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1813242">agreed</a> a joint approach to working with the Taliban. The EU position demands that any Taliban government must allow access to humanitarian aid.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Expect aircraft carriers to stay in the Middle East, US officials say, even as the military tries to pivot to China.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The American military’s involvement in Afghanistan could soon become largely the Navy’s responsibility, an ironic twist for a counterterrorism mission in a landlocked country.</p>



<p>Although the Navy has long privately bristled at the requirement to deploy one or even two aircraft carriers at a time to the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf to support the ground fights in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the lack of U.S.-controlled airfields near Afghanistan could mean more planes taking off from decks at sea.</p>



<p>And that could set off a fresh round of requests for more funding — and more hand-wringing among those who want the U.S. military to focus more on China.</p>



<p>“I think a lot of that mission is going to fall on the Navy,” said a Navy official who requested to speak on the condition of anonymity because the Pentagon’s plans have yet to be finalized. “This is a great example of why we need more money to operate forward — things like this are what we’re built to do, but we need the funding and support to keep doing it, and that hasn’t always been there.”</p>



<p>Worried about the reemergence of ISIS-K, or an emboldened al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the Biden administration has pledged to continue to launch “over the horizon” airstrikes from drones and manned aircraft. But it has yet to detail a plan for how those aircraft will collect intelligence on targets, or conduct sustained missions from such great distances.</p>



<p>Air Force pilots flying from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar or Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates have for years hit targets in Afghanistan, but they first have to wind their way through the Gulf around Iran, and back up through Pakistan, refueling at least once and often spending hours in the air before circling over a target.</p>



<p>“Land-based fighters in Qatar or Kuwait may not have the time on station to do close-air support missions for special operations forces,” said Bryan Clark, a former Navy officer now at the Hudson Institute. He said that could lead to the use of more long-loitering drones, and Navy aircraft flown from the North Arabian Sea.</p>



<p>Parking a carrier in the North Arabian Sea cuts some of that flight time, and allows pilots to fly over Pakistan before entering Afghanistan’s air space.</p>



<p>But those deployments mean wear and tear on crews and ships, and also require pulling assets from the Pacific, where the Biden administration says Washington’s true strategic interests lie.</p>



<p>That tension is on full display now. The Japan-based aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan flew F/A-18 Hornets over Kabul during the evacuation operation last month, and remains in the North Arabian Sea alongside the USS Iwo Jima, which launched the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit into Kabul at the same time.</p>



<p>For decades, the U.S. has based an aircraft carrier in Japan to project U.S. power in the Pacific on a consistent basis. The call to send the Reagan to the Middle East this spring raised hackles among China hawks as it left the entire Pacific region without a fully operational aircraft carrier for the entire summer.</p>



<p>Reagan&#8217;s absence was perhaps felt most acutely in June, when a large Russian naval task force — the biggest since the end of the Cold War,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-putin-summit-russia-naval-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Moscow</a>&nbsp;— edged uncomfortably close to Hawaii, leading the U.S. to scramble F-22s from Pearl Harbor to intercept bombers accompanying the flotilla.</p>



<p>At the time, the Reagan was in the Indian Ocean heading for its Afghanistan mission, and the USS Carl Vinson was still undergoing predeployment drills near Hawaii, practicing launching F-35s for the first time.</p>



<p>TheReagan took over the Middle East mission from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, allowing the ship to finally head home to Virginia after back-to-back deployments that kept it at sea for over 300 of the previous 500 days.</p>



<p>“They were supposed to remain in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic, but they ended up spending most of their deployment in the Middle East,” 2nd Fleet commander Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis told reporters when Eisenhower finally made it home in July.</p>



<p>“The Navy needs to get out from under that weight” of grinding deployments to the Middle East, Bryan Clark said. The Reagan will “likely remain there until relieved since the U.S. is now mounting counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and [drones] may not work for all situations.”</p>



<p>It won’t just be manned aircraft pulled into whatever continuing surveillance and strike missions deemed necessary by the Biden administration, however. Drones will undoubtedly play a significant role, and the relatively limited number of advanced, long-loitering aircraft available at any given time could also pull from the Indo-Pacific Command.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the airpower that we&#8217;ll employ in Afghanistan is going to be unmanned, and my guess is that demand on these assets will go through the roof,” said Bryan McGrath, a former destroyer captain and managing director of the FerryBridge Group consulting firm. That increased demand is unlikely to “make things any easier for the [intelligence and surveillance] tasks necessary for keeping track of the Chinese navy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whatever form the continuing air war in Afghanistan looks like, it will set off rounds of new budgetary requests for the Air Force and Navy, most likely.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re going to hear the Air Force say they’re tied down and they don&#8217;t have enough tankers” to refuel planes on long missions, said Brent Sadler, a retired Navy officer at the Heritage Foundation. “So give it to the Navy and let us build more fighters, because we need more fighters.”</p>



<p>On the other hand, “the Navy&#8217;s gonna say, ‘we&#8217;ll do it, but you’ve got to buy more aircraft carriers.’ So they&#8217;re both going to look at it as a chance to buy more stuff.”</p>



<p><br>In the end, there are only so many carriers available, and these extended deployments have led to longer maintenance periods, which have impacted carrier deployments across the globe.</p>



<p>That material cost “is unlikely to stop [U.S. Central Command] from requesting to have a carrier in the region for over-the-horizon capabilities,” said Becca Wasser at the Center for a New American Security.</p>



<p>For decades, commanders across the Pentagon’s geographic commands have asked for, and received, aircraft carriers to shadow their coastlines, and DoD leadership and the Navy have rarely said no. If the Biden administration stays focused on hunting down ISIS-K and al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan, that’s unlikely to change in Central Command, even without U.S. troops to support in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The Navy is getting some help, however. The new British carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is on her maiden cruise through the Pacific, stacked with F-35s flown by British and U.S. Marine pilots. This fall, Navy F-35 pilots will also start flying from a Japanese helicopter carrier, and in 2022 the new $13 billion aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford will deploy for the first time.</p>



<p>With more platforms will undoubtedly come more missions, and more requests. And if the past is prologue, those requests will get the green light.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Desperate to repatriate its citizens and avoid another refugee crisis, Europe has turned to Islamabad for help.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Meet Europe&#8217;s unexpected new best friend.</p>



<p>As the Continent scrambles to evacuate its citizens from Afghanistan and prevent a potential wave of refugees on its borders, Europe is reaching out to Pakistan — long seen as a pariah state — for help with both.</p>



<p>In only one week, the foreign ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. all visited Islamabad. They <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-plans-afghanistan-neighbors-host-refugees/">made promises of prompt cash</a> to Pakistani coffers for its assistance in the humanitarian crisis next door, and showered praise on the country for its help evacuating thousands of diplomatic staff and Afghan workers from Kabul. </p>



<p>Germany&#8217;s Ambassador to Pakistan Bernhard Schlagheck <a href="https://twitter.com/GermanyinPAK/status/1429680596222193664?s=20" target="_blank">said it would not have been possible</a> to fly out German and Dutch staff without Islamabad&#8217;s assistance, while Pakistan also received friendly calls from EU Council President Charles Michel, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, the <a href="https://twitter.com/SMQureshiPTI/status/1433361487419092998" target="_blank">Austrians</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/SMQureshiPTI/status/1433510156319481863" target="_blank">Slovenes</a>, who currently hold the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU.</p>



<p>This newfound affection for Pakistan is a significant shift in the diplomatic tides from this spring when the EU had eyes only for Pakistan&#8217;s arch-enemy India. In April, the EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-strategic-long-shot-more-warships-in-the-indo-pacific/">committed to an Indo-Pacific strategy</a> that is meant to see increased European cooperation with India against (Pakistan&#8217;s ally) China. In May, Brussels also launched <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-and-india-revive-stalled-trade-talks/">free-trade talks with New Delhi</a>. </p>



<p>The Taliban&#8217;s return in Kabul now gives Pakistan a prime opportunity to put itself back in the game. It is using the attention to try to rebrand its image internationally, and leverage its position as the main destination for Afghan refugees to exact concessions for its own priorities like economic aid, trade incentives, freer travel to Europe, and diplomatic support for the disputed region of Kashmir.</p>



<p>The overtures come at a crucial time, as both Pakistan and Europe are contending with the U.S.&#8217;s retreat from the region. Washington has long been Pakistan&#8217;s chief supplier of arms and aid as it sought Pakistan&#8217;s help in Afghanistan, but as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/02/us-pakistan-afghan-crisis-509157" target="_blank">that relationship soured</a> — especially as Pakistan provided aid to the Afghan Taliban even as the group targeted U.S. forces — Islamabad is looking to invest in other relationships. Europe, which was caught flat-footed by the U.S.&#8217;s decision to withdraw, must now secure its own interests in the region without American help.</p>



<h3>Friends in need</h3>



<p>Before the Afghan crisis, Pakistan was not popular in Brussels. The conservative Islamic country was routinely bashed for its human rights record and its duplicitous conduct in Afghanistan, where it simultaneously supported both NATO and the Taliban forces. While the EU is a major trading partner for Pakistan, the South Asian country is way down the EU&#8217;s priority list.</p>



<p>But all that has changed since the Taliban took over Afghanistan last month, leaving European countries desperate to repatriate their citizens.</p>



<p>Islamabad has underlined its role in helping European and foreign officials leave Kabul, including <a href="https://twitter.com/PakinNetherland/status/1433053134763528197" target="_blank">294 Dutch citizens</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmbassyPakBel/status/1433097511468666885" target="_blank">201 Belgians</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PakinItaly/status/1433057763777777664" target="_blank">216 Italians</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PakinDenmark/status/1433064144983445504" target="_blank">273 Danes</a>. In addition, Pakistan is also <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/883865-evacuation-from-afghanistan-around-4-000-people-to-land-in-karachi" target="_blank">helping evacuate</a> more than 4,000 Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. and allied forces in Kabul. The country was able to do so because of its strong ties to the Taliban, which allowed it to continue flights and keep its embassy open, even as most countries were scrambling to leave the country. </p>



<p>&#8220;We have tremendous admiration and respect for Pakistan and we would like to reiterate our gratitude,&#8221; Dutch Foreign Minister Sigrid Kaag <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1gqxvojmMlWKB" target="_blank">said at a press conference</a> in Islamabad on Wednesday.</p>



<p>U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who was in the capital the next day, announced that the U.K. was sending teams to Afghanistan&#8217;s neighbors, including Pakistan, to help process arrivals from Afghanistan and repatriate them to the U.K. He also announced that the U.K. was immediately sending £30 million to Afghanistan&#8217;s neighbors, Pakistan chief among them, to help them deal with the humanitarian crisis. </p>



<p>&#8220;Pakistan is a vital partner for the U.K.&#8221; Raab said.</p>



<p>In the long term, Europe believes Pakistan is crucial in averting a new wave of refugees. Hosting refugees is a toxic issue in Europe, and the Continent is keen to avoid the acrimony it experienced over the last influx that arrived on Europe&#8217;s borders in 2015 and 2016. Austria <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-austria-pm-wont-take-in-any-more-afghanistan-refugees-taliban/">vowed</a> not to take in any Afghan refugees after the Taliban took over the country this month, and French President Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-emmanuel-macron-europe-plan-afghanistan-migration-crisis-taliban/">said Europe</a> “must anticipate and protect ourselves against major irregular migratory flows&nbsp;that would endanger those who use them and feed trafficking of all kinds.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re seeking Pakistan&#8217;s help. The country already hosts millions of Afghan refugees, and Europe is hoping that with the right incentives, it would host a few more.</p>



<p>Only a few months ago, when the two countries&#8217; foreign ministers met, Germany <a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/maas-qureshi/2453556" target="_blank">pointed out</a> Pakistan&#8217;s depressed economic state, its repressive blasphemy laws and the lack of protection for minorities. </p>



<p>Last weekend, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas&#8217;s tone was <a href="https://twitter.com/AuswaertigesAmt/status/1432626560226496512" target="_blank">markedly different</a>: &#8220;As a neighbor of Afghanistan, Pakistan in particular is feeling the effects of the crisis. Germany won’t abandon the region. In addition to our financial commitment, we will continue concrete projects, such as in border management.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dutch Foreign Minister Kaag said in Islamabad: &#8220;We&#8217;re mindful and grateful for the longstanding hosting role Pakistan has played for the refugees over the years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We will explore ways in which we can assist Pakistan in its role as a hosting nation to refugees and wanting to invest and make use of the improving climate to attract business and invest in Pakistan itself.&#8221;</p>



<h3>A simple favor</h3>



<p>Aware of its leverage, Pakistan is trying to push for a host of trade and economic perks in addition to trying to rebrand.</p>



<p>Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi pushed Raab to take Pakistan off the country&#8217;s &#8220;red list,&#8221; which bans travel to the U.K. for countries where it deems the coronavirus is too severe. Raab confirmed that Pakistani and British officials are meeting on Monday to discuss it. It also asked Raab to support removing Pakistan from the &#8220;grey list&#8221; of an international anti-money laundering and terrorist financing initiative, known as the Financial Action Task Force, which, apart from being a stain on its international reputation, makes it harder for Pakistan to access international credit. </p>



<p>Islamabad is also trying to convince EU countries to keep a trade scheme called the GSP+, which allows Pakistan to export goods to Europe at low or zero tariffs. The scheme is predicated on Pakistan improving its human rights record, including child labor, freedom of the press and religious freedoms, but human rights groups have documented a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/2019-pakistan-in-review/" target="_blank">worsening outlook</a>.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s pushing Europe to once again allow its national carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, to fly to the bloc. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153" target="_blank">Regulators banned PIA</a> from flying to Europe since June last year when it emerged that hundreds of pilots working for the airline may have gotten fake licenses.</p>



<p>All that&#8217;s in addition to asking for oodles of economic aid to host incoming refugees, which many European countries have duly promised, and diplomatic support for Kashmir, a region that both Pakistan and India claim as their own.</p>



<h3>Or else &#8230;</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s likely that Pakistan will drive a hard bargain. Having seen how Turkey negotiated its deal to keep asylum seekers from entering Europe, Pakistan is pursuing a similar strategy. </p>



<p>“If the refugees come to Pakistan, they will have an effect on us,&#8221; Pakistan&#8217;s Ambassador to the EU Zaheer Aslam Janjua told POLITICO last month. &#8220;And then they may not stop there, and they may move on to other countries as well. It is for the other countries to do their bit.”</p>



<p>Since 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Pakistan has been crucial to ensuring diplomatic, trade and logistical links between Afghanistan and the rest of the world. With Afghanistan now in the hands of the Taliban, a group Pakistan knows intimately, it&#8217;s likely that any country wanting to do business with them will need Pakistan&#8217;s help.</p>



<p>Pakistan is hoping for the West&#8217;s continued engagement — and warned of the consequences if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>&#8220;Abandonment would be dangerous, and nobody will gain from that. And nobody can predict the consequences of that,&#8221; Qureshi said. </p>



<p>It was unclear if he was referring to Pakistan or Afghanistan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Conservative candidate turns to an old frenemy within a new team.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>BERLIN — With his conservative alliance plumbing fresh depths in the polls, German chancellor hopeful Armin Laschet unveiled a new “Team for the Future” on Friday — complete with a blast from the past.</p>



<p>While Laschet said the team would advise him on key policy areas, flashy choreography aired on live TV suggested it will rather resemble a shadow Cabinet intended to highlight the party’s expertise across issues ranging from the environment to the economy.</p>



<p>“There are just 23 days until the election, and it’s now time to focus on the issues,” Laschet said. “We’re facing a fundamental decision about the direction of German politics.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, the presentation at the party headquarters of Laschet’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Berlin was meant to breathe new life into his moribund campaign, which has struggled to halt — much less reverse — a precipitous drop in the polls over the past six weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given Laschet’s personal ratings are even lower than his party&#8217;s, a last-minute turnaround looks like a long shot.&nbsp;He previously resisted calls from within the party to present a shadow Cabinet, betting that focusing the public&#8217;s attention on him as the frontman was the better strategy — a call many analysts had questioned. </p>



<p>&#8220;One thing this shows is that he&#8217;s clearly capable of correcting mistakes,&#8221; said Ursula Münch, a professor of political science at the University of the Bundeswehr in Munich. </p>



<p>Support for the CDU and their Bavarian allies has fallen to 20 percent from 29 percent in mid-July, according to the benchmark <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend/deutschlandtrend-2735.html" target="_blank">Deutschlandtrend</a> poll commissioned by Germany’s ARD public broadcaster. The result, the lowest-ever recorded for the conservative alliance in the poll’s more than 20-year history, signaled that similar readings from other institutes in recent days weren’t an anomaly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to POLITICO&#8217;s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/">Poll of Polls</a>, which aggregates the results from leading polling firms, the Social Democrats — the bloc&#8217;s historic center-left rival — leads the race with 24 percent, while the conservatives are second with 21 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best-known member of Laschet’s kitchen Cabinet, and the first he called on stage, is Friedrich Merz, a right-wing corporate lawyer Laschet bested earlier this year in the race to lead the CDU.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laschet’s decision to turn to Merz — <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/friedrich-merz-cdu-right-wing-meet-the-german-donald-trump/">a controversial figure</a> who in the early 2000s lost out to Angela Merkel in a battle to lead the CDU before all but disappearing from politics, reemerging after she announced her retirement — underscores the growing desperation in his campaign, which has suffered from repeated gaffes and doubts over his ability to lead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 65, Merz hardly fits the future-oriented image Laschet sought to project on Friday. And though Laschet presented him as a “business expert,” Merz’s record in the private sector, which consists almost entirely of serving on corporate boards and lobbying, is mixed.</p>



<p>What Merz does have that Laschet lacks, however, is the allegiance of the right wing of the CDU, which sees the lawyer as the last defender of traditional German values and mores.</p>

<p>But even if Merz can deliver those votes for Laschet — a big if — it might come at the cost of another key constituency: Women. Polling has shown women, especially those who voted for Merkel, are deeply skeptical of Merz, suggesting Laschet’s ploy could backfire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A more acute problem is that Laschet and Merz aren’t on the same page on key policy questions. Speaking to the CDU’s business wing earlier this week, Merz <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1810138">lashed out</a> at the European Union’s proposed carbon border levy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the European Union implements the planned carbon tax,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it wouldn’t just mark the end of free trade policy, but the beginning of a new global trade conflict in which everyone would lose.” </p>



<p>He went on to say the next German government needed to do everything necessary to prevent carbon levy “nonsense,” suggesting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (a Laschet ally) was to blame for the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most surprising within Merz’s intervention was that the CDU itself endorsed the Commission’s plan in its latest party program, in which it explicitly calls for a carbon border levy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The episode highlights the risk Laschet is taking by embracing Merz, who isn’t known for being a team player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other seven members of Laschet’s new team are experts in their respective fields, but little known to the general public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the overriding theme of the show was renewal and innovation, promising an acceleration of reform on environmental policy and more investment in technology, it wasn’t immediately clear why voters should buy such promises from representatives of a party that has been in power for the past 16 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laschet’s point-woman for technology and innovation, for example, is Dorothee Bär, who pledged to “ignite a new digital turbo.” Her current position in Merkel’s government for the past several years: State minister for digital affairs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The plan 'does not mean recognition,' but the EU does need to liaise with the Taliban on critical issues.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The EU has agreed on a common approach to working with the Taliban, the EU&#8217;s top diplomat said Friday — putting human rights and security conditions on engaging the Afghanistan militant group. </p>



<p>The announcements arrived during an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Slovenia and partly reflected proposals put forward by France and Germany in two joint documents seen by POLITICO. Josep Borrell, the bloc&#8217;s senior diplomat, listed <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/103712/afghanistan-press-statement-high-representative-josep-borrell-informal-meeting-foreign_en" target="_blank">five benchmarks</a> to &#8220;engage&#8221; with the Taliban. But, he stressed, it &#8220;does not mean recognition&#8221; of the Taliban as the legitimate Afghanistan government.</p>



<p>Still, the approach raises questions about whether the plan will essentially lead to a de facto recognition of the Taliban, several weeks after the group seized control of Afghanistan. With western forces now gone from the country, the EU needs to liaise with the Taliban on critical issues, such as remaining Europeans and Afghans seeking to leave the country and the possibility of resurgent terrorist cells. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is an engagement with the Taliban themselves, the international community is pressing for it,&#8221; Borrell said. </p>



<p>The decision comes as EU rivals China and Russia have begun friendly overtures to the Taliban, forcing the issue for EU officials who also want to try and influence the group.</p>



<p>On Monday, the U.N  Security Council <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/sc14620.doc.htm" target="_blank">agreed</a> on a resolution for working with the Taliban that focused on counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance. Beijing and Moscow abstained, allowing the resolution to go through. The abstention raised faint hopes among diplomats that western allies could work with China and Russia on the subject.</p>



<p>On Friday, the EU fleshed out its own approach. </p>



<p>The five benchmarks Borrell listed focused on security and human rights. The Taliban cannot let Afghanistan serve as a base for terrorism and basic human rights must be respected. Any Taliban government must be inclusive and allow access to humanitarian aid. And finally, they must let both foreigners and Afghans leave the country.</p>



<p>Engagement &#8220;will increase depending on the behavior of this government,&#8221; Borrell stressed. And, he noted, it could eventually include &#8220;a joint European Union presence in Kabul,&#8221; but only &#8220;if the security conditions are met&#8221; —&nbsp;a big &#8220;if.&#8221; Currently, the EU&#8217;s diplomatic staff is not in Kabul, Afghanistan&#8217;s capital, having left during the final days of the military operation.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether EU countries with Kabul embassies have formally begun closing their outposts. One official said countries have not started the closure process. Still, Borrell stressed that any future EU presence &#8220;is not a first step towards recognition at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>EU foreign ministers on Friday also agreed on a strategy to coordinate engagement with the countries surrounding Afghanistan, where it&#8217;s expected most Afghan refugees will initially head. According to the U.N. Refugee Agency, more than <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/asia/afghanistan-emergency.html" target="_blank">two million Afghan</a> refugees are already registered in Pakistan and Iran, the result of the 20-year war back home.</p>



<p>Borrell said his department, the European External Action Service &#8220;will initiate a regional political platform of cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbors.&#8221; </p>



<p>The decisions largely resemble two documents, marked as &#8220;<a href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/documents/analyses/no-240-restricted-documents.pdf" target="_blank">restricted,</a>&#8221; that France and Germany circulated before the meeting.</p>



<p>The first document outlined the strategy for engaging with the Taliban. </p>



<p>&#8220;The recognition of the political legitimacy of the new authorities can be used as leverage,&#8221; the two EU powerhouses wrote. &#8220;Countries could condition recognition of the political authority and legitimacy of the Taliban to the commitments they would be ready to take following clear expectations.&#8221; </p>



<p>The second document discusses the plan to work with Afghanistan&#8217;s neighbors on migration. </p>



<p>Under this plan, the document said, &#8220;the EU would take the lead in initiating a regional political platform of cooperation.&#8221; In addition to Pakistan and Iran, it listed other potential partners as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and India. The document indicated a &#8220;regional conference&#8221; could be held soon on the issue. But a second official said not everyone had embraced the proposal, and the conference idea didn&#8217;t come up in Friday&#8217;s discussions.</p>



<p>The next step, two diplomats said, is for EU countries to draft a common text that can be discussed at a formal meeting of EU foreign ministers next month.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The agreement will probably have little impact on vaccination within Europe, as the EU will end up donating many of these doses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The EU and AstraZeneca saga is over —&nbsp;hopefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Commission and AstraZeneca announced Friday that they reached a deal for the drugmaker to supply 200 million doses by the end of March 2022 and end the contentious legal battle that was set to continue later this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dispute began in January, when AstraZeneca announced massive delivery delays to the bloc. The news set off an embarrassing year for the EU executive, which had championed the EU’s joint purchase of vaccines and was suddenly blindsided by one of its biggest vaccine suppliers at the beginning of the EU&#8217;s vaccine rollout. </p>



<p>The Commission, backed by EU countries, then <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-preparing-legal-case-against-astrazeneca-over-vaccine-shortfalls/">took the fight</a> to the Belgian courts in April, pushing the company to deliver by the end of September the entire 300 million doses that countries had ordered — roughly three months behind schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The court’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/court-ruling-in-astrazeneca-commission-vaccine-coronavirus-covid19-case-gives-something-to-both-sides/">emergency ruling in June</a> wasn&#8217;t a clear win for either party, but also not an expensive loss they feared. The judge ruled that AstraZeneca violated its contract with the EU but ordered the company to deliver only 80 million doses by the end of September — a mere 10 million more than the amount the company had delivered by that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A longer case on the substance of the EU’s claim was supposed to continue in September, but with both parties largely satisfied and few EU countries in need of the viral vector doses, the Commission and AstraZeneca decided to call it quits and end their fight.</p>



<p>Commission spokesperson Stefan De Keersmaecker defended taking the Anglo-Swedish company to court in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our fundamental goal has been, from the beginning, the delivery of a sufficient number of doses,” De Keersmaecker told reporters. “We are now beyond the litigation phase. We have now reached a settlement agreement, which is in the interest of both parties, which has strict delivery arrangements, and which has the firm commitment to deliver these doses.”</p>



<p>Under the settlement announced Friday, the Anglo-Swedish vaccine producer agreed to provide 60 million doses by the end of the third quarter, another 75 million by the end of 2021, and the last 65 million by March 2022. The company said it already delivered 100 million doses at the end of June, and 140 million doses to date.</p>



<p>EU countries will receive regular delivery schedules and get a rebate on delayed doses: 10 percent for one month of delays; 25 percent for two months; and 40 percent for three months or more.</p>



<p>The rebate won&#8217;t apply if the delay is beyond the &#8220;reasonable control,&#8221; of AstraZeneca, &#8220;which will bear the burden of proof,&#8221; according to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_4562" target="_blank">the Commission</a>.</p>



<p>A company spokesperson said AstraZeneca is &#8220;confident&#8221; it can deliver according to the new schedule.</p>



<p>With the EU boasting that 70 percent of its population is already fully vaccinated, few EU countries see a great need for the vaccine and plan to push mRNA shots from the biggest producer BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;While this week we reached the important milestone of 70 percent full vaccination of the EU&#8217;s adult population, there are significant differences in vaccination rates between our Member States, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca&#8217;s, remain crucial,&#8221; Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides wrote <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4561" target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p>



<p>Most of the vaccines will be donated to third countries, however. The EU collectively promised to donate at least 200 million doses by the end of the year. A document from the summer showed most of the pledged doses will be Oxford/AstraZeneca shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m very pleased that we have been able to reach a common understanding which allows us to move forward and work in collaboration with the European Commission to help overcome the pandemic,&#8221; Ruud Dobber, AstraZeneca&#8217;s executive vice president for biopharmaceuticals, wrote in a press release.</p>



<p>Some experts suggest that if booster shots are needed in the not-too-distant future, people who have received mRNA vaccines could benefit from a different vaccine type like the viral vector shot from Oxford/AstraZeneca. Still, the Commission has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-approves-novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-deal-finally/">contracts</a> with producers of other platforms, like Novavax, which developed a protein-based vaccine that&#8217;s awaiting EU regulators’ approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The government has come under heavy fire for not rolling out vaccinations to kids over 12 in time for their return to school. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.K.’s advisory committee on vaccinations said Friday healthy children aged 12 to 15 should not be offered a jab against COVID-19.</p>



<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization said that while the benefits of vaccinating healthy children “are marginally greater” than the potential harms, “the margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal vaccination of healthy 12 to 15 year olds at this time.”</p>



<p>The government has come under heavy fire for not rolling out vaccinations to kids over 12 in time for their return to school. Countries across Europe have been vaccinating this age group for some time to prepare for the school year when the Delta variant is prevalent.</p>



<p>Pressure mounted further Friday with a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-faces-backlash-over-lack-of-coronavirus-protections-in-englands-schools/">letter</a> published by the British Medical Journal, signed by scores of concerned doctors, educators and parents. They pointed out that 40 to 50 kids under 18 are being admitted to hospital every day due to COVID-19, while 34,000 children are currently living with long COVID.</p>



<p>Wei Shen Lim, chair of COVID-19 immunization for the JCVI, said that for healthy young people, “their risk of severe COVID-19 disease is small and therefore the potential for benefit from COVID-19 vaccination is also small.” He said the committee was taking a “precautionary approach” by not recommending vaccinating this group.</p>



<p>The committee underlined that the vast majority of children had mild or no symptoms. It also pointed out the very low risk of heart inflammation with mRNA vaccines, noting that the long-term effects of this were unknown.</p>



<p>The JCVI said, however, that it was beyond its remit to consider any potential wider societal impacts of vaccination, including in education. “The government may wish to seek further views on the wider societal and educational impacts from the Chief Medical Officers of the U.K. four nations,” the JCVI said in a statement.</p>



<p>In a letter to the four CMOs, Health Secretary Sajid Javid and his counterparts from the other three nations asked the countries’ top doctors to “consider the matter from a broader perspective, as suggested by the JCVI.” The health ministers also urged the CMOs to report back “as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the committee added to the current list of vulnerable over 12s who should be eligible, including those with hematological malignancy, sickle cell disease, Type 1 diabetes and congenital heart disease.</p>

<p>An international group of scientists, supported by parents and educators, today called on U.K. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to re-introduce a raft of pandemic protections for children in schools, warning that scrapping most of those measures is &#8220;reckless.&#8221; </p>



<p>Children across the U.K. are returning to school at a time when rates of infection are 26 times higher in the broad population than this time last year —  but this time, they face the more infectious Delta variant, the groups warned in a<a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/09/03/englands-schools-must-be-made-safe-an-open-letter-to-the-education-secretary/" target="_blank"> letter</a> to the British Medical Journal. </p>



<p>Serious cases among children are not uncommon, with 2,300 kids under 18 hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past two months, and 40-50 hospitalizations in that group per day. Meanwhile, there are an estimated 34,000 children living with long COVID in the U.K., the letter points out. It also notes that one in 50 primary school children and one in 40 secondary school children currently have prevalent infection.</p>



<p>Despite this rising risk, England has gone against the advice of both the <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-in-children-and-the-role-of-school-settings-in-transmission-second-update.pdf" target="_blank">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control</a>&nbsp;(ECDC) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html" target="_blank">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;(CDC), which call for vaccinating teenagers and ensuring pupils and staff wear masks.</p>



<p>Instead, Williamson’s department <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/schools-covid-19-operational-guidance" target="_blank">states</a> that masks aren&#8217;t necessary in classes and has dropped the requirement for social bubbles and contact tracing. Children won&#8217;t be required to isolate if there&#8217;s a case in their class, except “in exceptional cases.” Antigen tests twice a week for secondary schools will run through September and then be reviewed.</p>



<p>The authors list nine mitigation policies, including vaccinating all 12s and over; reinstating face masks in secondary schools; making urgent investments in ventilation and filtration systems; reinstating bubbles and contact tracing; and supporting and allowing remote learning.</p>



<p>Scotland, <a href="https://gov.wales/schools-coronavirus-guidance" target="_blank">Wales</a> and <a href="https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-school-and-educational-settings-northern-ireland" target="_blank">Northern Ireland</a> have also relaxed their rules on contact tracing, isolation and bubbles, but Scotland has <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/impact-assessment-reducing-risks-schools-guidance-back-school-arrangements-august-2021/" target="_blank">maintained</a> face coverings for secondary school staff and students since schools re-opened August 17. Cases have also been rising sharply there since early August.</p>
