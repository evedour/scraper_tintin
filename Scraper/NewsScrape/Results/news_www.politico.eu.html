					<description><![CDATA[Maria Kolesnikova and Maksim Znak found guilty by Minsk court.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two key opposition figures in Belarus, Maria Kolesnikova and Maksim Znak, were on Monday jailed for threatening national security.</p>



<p>A Minsk court found both guilty of threatening national security and conspiring to seize power during protests against the rule of President Alexander Lukashenko, <a href="https://www.belta.by/incident/view/mariju-kolesnikovu-i-maksima-znaka-priznali-vinovnymi-458521-2021/" target="_blank">state media reported</a>. Both will serve their sentences in penal camps. Protest organizer Kolesnikova was jailed for 11 years while lawyer Znak received 10 years.</p>



<p>In August 2020, Kolesnikova and Znak <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/alexander-lukashenko-belarus-opposition-leaders-hunt/">co-founded the Coordination Council</a>, a non-governmental body aiming to facilitate the democratic transfer of power away from Lukashenko.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not expect any surprises and of course no just verdict,&#8221; <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/prozess-kolesnikowa-101.html" target="_blank">Kolesnikova&#8217;s father commented</a> when court proceedings started in August.</p>



<p>Western states have repeatedly criticized Belarus&#8217; crackdown on opposition figures since a disputed election in August 2020, resulting in sanctions from both the EU and U.S. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jan Hecker's cause and exact time of death remain unclear.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Germany’s Ambassador to China Jan Hecker has died, the German foreign ministry&nbsp;<a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/newsroom/-/2480126" target="_blank">confirmed</a>&nbsp;on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cause and exact time of his death remain unclear. Hecker, formerly German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s diplomatic and security adviser, only began his Beijing job <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/wjb_673085/zzjg_673183/t1901440.shtml" target="_blank">two weeks ago</a>.</p>



<p>“It is with deep sadness and dismay that we learned of the sudden death of the German Ambassador to China,&#8221; a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.</p>



<p>“Our thoughts at this moment are with his family and the people who were close to him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hecker’s immediate family is currently in Beijing. He was survived by his wife, also working in the embassy, and three children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hecker, a former federal judge and coordinator of Germany&#8217;s refugee policy, was a close aide to Merkel. His appointment to China was seen as the outgoing chancellor’s bid to ensure diplomatic stability for German-Chinese relations.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the multipolar age, we must find new foreign policy measures to spread Western values both at home and internationally.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Nathalie Toccie is a Pierre Keller visiting professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, a board member of ENI and the author of </em>POLITICO<em>&#8216;s World View column.</em></p>



<p>Why are Europeans so upset about Joe Biden?</p>



<p>In the wake of the United States’ shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Continent’s leaders have done little to conceal their frustration with the U.S. president’s foreign policy.</p>



<p>But while genuine distress for the plight of Afghans, especially women and children, is understandable, their broader concerns are overblown. Were they to listen carefully, they would realize that Biden sounds, if anything, quintessentially European. They’d discover that while there may be problems with the U.S., those problems are just as present at home.</p>



<p>At the center of European concerns are fears about the return of U.S. isolationism. When Biden took office, announcing that “America is back,” Europeans, traumatized by four years of Donald Trump’s presidency, had replied suspiciously: “For how long?” Since then, Biden has taken a series of moves that suggest the question is still an open one. If the U.S. so readily turned away from Afghanistan, could it do the same in the Balkans — and perhaps in the Baltics too?</p>



<p>This existential worry is misplaced. There is nothing the Biden administration has said or done that suggests a diminished commitment to European security. The president’s foreign policy doctrine is that of a great power that understands its resources are finite and is strategically choosing to channel them where it matters most: against its major adversaries — China and Russia — and toward its liberal democratic allies, notably in Europe. The withdrawal from Afghanistan, chaotic as it may have been, does not undermine but rather reinforces that point.</p>



<p>Spelling out his foreign policy in the wake of the debacle in Afghanistan, Biden <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?514378-1/president-biden-defends-us-withdrawal-afghanistan" target="_blank">declared</a> that “human rights will be the center of our foreign policy. But the way to do that is not through endless military deployments, but through diplomacy, economic tools and rallying the rest of the world for support.”</p>



<p>That’s as European as it gets.</p>



<p>Europeans are also deeply frustrated about the lack of coordination in Afghanistan. That is a fair criticism, but it is not new. Lack of consultation has been an age-old irritant in the transatlantic relationship, across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.</p>



<p>America’s allies have long been presented with its decisions to intervene militarily as <em>faits accomplis</em>, with participation expected nonetheless. In the 1990s and the 2000s, from the Balkans to the Middle East, many in Europe felt that Americans did the cooking, while they were left with the unhappy chore of washing up.</p>



<p>There is, however, one good reason for Europeans to be upset about Afghanistan. It runs counter to an important trend in Western foreign policy: the return of liberal values.</p>



<p>After a decade in which the West was consumed by the financial crisis, forever wars, democratic setbacks in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and the rise of nationalist populism, it has slowly been rediscovering its raison d&#8217;être.</p>



<p>The looming confrontation with China and Russia is being interpreted as a clash between political systems and ideologies. And so, liberal democracy and authoritarianism have once again become the dominant signifiers — and abandoning Afghans to the Taliban feels like a retreat from the very thing the West stands for.</p>



<p>But while the return of values to Western foreign policy should, of course, be welcomed, that does not mean we should return to the past. Gone are the days of democracy promotion through military interventions and nation building — as Biden’s foreign policy doctrine rightfully states.</p>



<p>Humanitarian interventions, sanctions, development and trade conditionality, the socialization of elites through diplomacy and civil society — these may have worked at the height of the liberal international order. Today, they’re unlikely to deliver.</p>



<p>These methods might still have a chance of working in places like Georgia or Ukraine, but in most others they’re likely to be ineffective. It is not just Afghanistan. Think of Belarus, Serbia or Turkey.</p>



<p>The question then becomes how to square that circle. If values cannot be ignored but also cannot be promoted abroad in the way they once were, then how can they be applied?</p>



<p>Part of the answer is internal: Given democratic setbacks on both sides of the Atlantic, there’s plenty of work to do building better liberal democracy at home.</p>



<p>But there’s also a need for an international component — and it’s this that is causing so much discomfort in the U.S. and Europe, as policymakers and leaders struggle to find a way forward. It may not be possible to spread Western values at the point of a gun, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t find other ways to do so.</p>



<p>Successfully promoting Western values in our multipolar age will require new policy instruments and methods, blending principles and pragmatism. It will require Europeans to take on greater responsibility and risk taking, not just on paper but in practice too. And it will entail devising new multilateral formats to support liberal values, whether through new institutions or more informal settings, like Biden’s plans for a summit of democratic countries.</p>



<p>Most importantly, it will require Europeans to put themselves at ease with Biden’s approach and work together with the U.S. in the mutual interest of both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tax hikes, vaccine passports and the fallout from Afghanistan mean MPs start the new term in a tetchy mood. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON —&nbsp;Boris Johnson could be forgiven for feeling some back-to-school nerves as his MPs return to Westminster from their summer break.</p>



<p>With a big promise to fix England&#8217;s straining system of adult social care unfulfilled more than two years after he won a landslide election victory, the prime minister looks set to break two major tax promises to help make good on the pledge.</p>



<p>It all comes after a summer dominated by criticism of the government&#8217;s response to the fall of Afghanistan and means the U.K. leader faces a tricky few weeks before parliament breaks again for Westminster&#8217;s conference season, with goodwill from his own party in short supply.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is a lot of annoyance and anger with the government about its own goals in the last couple of months,&#8221; one Conservative MP and former Cabinet minister said. </p>



<p>MPs are still smarting after the government had to swiftly reverse a decision to allow Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to avoid self-isolation. &#8220;The government appears to be fighting battles it doesn&#8217;t need to on the ground that isn&#8217;t natural Conservative territory,&#8221; one senior Tory in local government said.</p>



<p>Social care, which provides older and disabled people with help in day-to-day living, looks set to dominate the first week back. England&#8217;s care system has come under intense financial strain in recent years after a long period of underfunding and deferred decisions on sustainable reforms.</p>



<p>Reports over the weekend say ministers are preparing to increase a tax on earnings and self-employed profits to better fund the system. But that sparked immediate concern from Conservative MPs, who were elected in 2019 on a promise not to hike national insurance, income tax or value-added tax. Others inside government were blunter.</p>



<p>“After all that’s happened in the last 18 months they can’t seriously be thinking about a tax raid on supermarket workers and nurses so the children of Surrey homeowners can receive bigger inheritances,&#8221; one Cabinet minister told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/09/04/tories-war-idiotic-national-insurance-tax-increase/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=ccf1b3659b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_05_11_55&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-ccf1b3659b-190048001" target="_blank">the Sunday Telegraph</a>.</p>



<p>Conservative MP Steve Baker, a key Brexit rebel during Theresa May&#8217;s stormy time as prime minister,&nbsp;<a href="https://politico.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e26c1a1c392386a968d02fdbc&amp;id=4b8a2d5976&amp;e=a08ce47196" target="_blank">told the same paper</a>: “Of all the ways to break manifesto tax pledges to fund the NHS and social care, raising NIC must be the worst. In this time of crisis, we need a zero-based review of what the state does and how it is funded.” </p>



<p>Former Chancellor Philip Hammond told Times Radio this weekend that a rise would provoke a “very significant backlash” that would damage the government — and vowed to oppose such a plan in the House of Lords.</p>



<p>Local government is on the sharp end of the social care crisis, a pressing issue for many local Tory activists. But while the local government figure quoted above acknowledged the need for a fix — he questioned whether hiking national insurance is a fair way to do it.</p>



<p>It would be &#8220;a bit rich&#8221; to protect the older generation at the expense of their children and grandchildren, he said, adding: &#8220;There are people who got married 40 years ago, bought a house for £10,000 in the stockbroker belt which they have sold for over a million pounds, while there are youngsters who are basically living in rented accommodation, and finding it very difficult.&#8221;</p>



<p>Others are skeptical about any tax rise at all. The Tory MP quoted above wants Johnson&#8217;s plan to involve systemic changes, not just fresh cash. &#8220;The system needs complete reform, for example technology to keep people in their homes longer. We need to reform systems. If we don&#8217;t reform systems, there is no point paying in money. Why are we giving more money for a system that has failed?&#8221;</p>



<p>In a bid to address that question of intergenerational fairness, the government is reportedly flirting with breaking a second manifesto pledge. The Conservatives have long promised that the state pension will rise every April by either the rate of inflation, earnings growth or 2.5 percent, whichever is highest. </p>



<p>But after wages jumped 8.8 percent in the past year, an under-strain Treasury wants to swerve a £4 billion spending increase — teeing up a big break with the government&#8217;s own promises unlikely to go unnoticed by MPs.</p>



<p>Against that difficult backdrop, Johnson also faces renewed mutterings from his own side about the coronavirus pandemic and more. A second former minister expects a “difficult time for government ahead,&#8221; with not only the “sound of breaking manifesto promises crashing around&#8221; but a squeeze on public spending; more Brexit flare-ups; and mounting calls for inquiries into the pandemic and Afghanistan.</p>



<p>They also warned that a fourth wave of the virus could see mounting calls for fresh restrictions, and Johnson is already doubling down on plans to bring in a vaccine certification scheme for large events — a move that risks fresh unease from Tory MPs.</p>



<p>Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi dismissed such a move just months ago, but told Sky News on Sunday: “The best thing to do is to work with the industry to make sure they can open safely and sustainably in the long term and the best way to do that is to check the vaccine status.&#8221;</p>



<p>Expect plenty on his own benches to disagree. Another MP said their position had not changed over the summer — and that their opposition is &#8220;total.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[David Sassoli and Manfred Weber aim to strengthen positions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Parliament has barely returned from its summer break but already two of its main players are plotting to hold onto power or gain more clout, according to officials and MEPs.</p>



<p>The Parliament&#8217;s president, David Sassoli, and Manfred Weber, president of the center-right European People&#8217;s Party group, are at the heart of the action, although neither has openly declared his plans.</p>



<p>At stake in this bout of presidential shadow boxing is control of key legislative levers as the European Union seeks to emerge from the coronavirus crisis and pass laws on slashing carbon emissions, boosting the digital economy, regulating tech giants and other pressing issues.</p>



<p>And whoever is the Parliament&#8217;s president for the second half of its five-year term will face the challenge of trying to hold together an ever-more fractious assembly in the run-up to the next election.</p>



<p>Sassoli, an Italian social democrat, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/david-sassoli-elected-european-parliament-president/">unexpectedly became Parliament president</a> in 2019 as part of a broader agreement to dole out top EU jobs, struck by the bloc&#8217;s leaders two years ago. Under that deal, Sassoli was expected to stand down when his term ends in January, to be replaced by a conservative.</p>



<p>However, Sassoli has begun quietly campaigning for a second term, MEPs say.</p>



<p>“Sassoli’s candidacy is an open secret,” one MEP from a southern European country said. “I have seen him more in my office than ever before.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Weber, leader of the largest faction in the Parliament, is planning a different presidential power play.</p>



<p>Many expected the Bavarian to succeed Sassoli as Parliament president. But officials say Weber now intends to become president of the EPP itself — an alliance of center-right and conservative parties from across the Continent — as well as being re-elected chairman of<strong> </strong>its group in the Parliament.</p>



<p>Such a move would be less prestigious than taking on the presidency of one of the main EU institutions. But it would arguably give Weber more real power — as a pivotal figure coordinating conservative MEPs and national leaders, including heads of state and government.</p>



<p>To make that idea a reality, however, current EPP President Donald Tusk would need to step down. Over the summer, Tusk <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-tusk-poland-politics-civic-platform/">re-took the leadership</a> of the Civic Platform party in his native Poland but he has yet to make clear whether he will bow out as EPP chief.</p>



<h2>Sassoli&#8217;s strategy</h2>



<p>For decades, the election of the Parliament president was a pre-cooked arrangement made by a &#8220;grand coalition&#8221; of socialists and conservatives, the leading forces in the assembly.</p>



<p>But the two main groups saw their power diluted in the 2019 European Parliament election and it&#8217;s increasingly hard to put together clear majorities in the more diverse chamber.</p>



<p>Sassoli was elected in July 2019 thanks to a &nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/surprise-finish-uncertain-consequences-in-race-to-choose-new-eu-leaders/">“top jobs” package</a>&nbsp;that made the EPP&#8217;s Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission and Charles Michel, championed by the centrist Renew Europe group, in charge at the European Council.</p>



<p>The agreement was meant to reflect the bloc’s political equilibrium following the election. It foresaw Sassoli relinquishing the top Parliament job to the EPP at the end of his two-and-half-year term, rather than seeking a second stint in the post.</p>



<p>Socialist MEPs and parliamentary officials have increasingly questioned the legitimacy of such a deal, which would mean less clout and prestige for Europe&#8217;s second-largest political force. </p>



<p>They also say Sassoli is frustrated because so much of his term has been<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-wont-return-to-strasbourg-for-months/"> overshadowed by </a>the COVID-19 crisis, including overseeing the introduction of complex measures to protect MEPs and staff. That has meant he has had less time to focus on political matters, they argue.</p>



<p>“He had to run a hospital,” one senior Parliament official said.</p>



<p>As evidence the former TV journalist is campaigning behind the scenes, parliamentary officials point to his proposals — launched before the summer break — to set up “focus groups” with a select number of MEPs to discuss the Parliament&#8217;s post-COVID future. Many see that as a re-election platform.</p>



<p>Sassoli&#8217;s spokesman, Roberto Cuillo, said the Parliament president “will not make any comment” on his future ambitions.</p>



<p>The Italian faces an uphill task to convince MEPs beyond his own Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group that he&#8217;s entitled to run for re-election.</p>



<p>“The EPP is determined to claim the EU parliament presidency next January, since this was agreed with the S&amp;D and Renew in 2019,” one EPP official said.</p>



<p>If Weber does not run for the Parliament presidency, the official added, the EPP group will prioritize senior female candidates, including Roberta Metsola, a Maltese vice president of the Parliament and Dutch MEP Esther de Lange, a vice president of the EPP group.</p>



<p>An official from the Renew Europe group said that most MEPs in his faction would also honor the 2019 deal and support an EPP candidate for the Parliament presidency.</p>



<h2>Weber&#8217;s way</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Weber is set to announce at a group meeting on Wednesday that he intends to replace Tusk as the new EPP president, while seeking re-election as chairman of EPP parliamentary group in the months to come, according to several EPP and Parliament officials. </p>



<p>His plan to run for the party presidency was <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/manfred-weber-evp-tusk-1.5394159" target="_blank">first reported</a> in Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.</p>



<p>But Tusk&#8217;s own plans remain unclear.</p>



<p>“Currently, there is no set date for Tusk to end his mandate early,” an EPP spokesperson said. “His mandate officially ends in November 2022 and as of yet, there is no set date for the election of a new president.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Weber made clear the faction expected one of its members to become Parliament president but declined to specify Weber&#8217;s own plans.</p>



<p>“With the midterm approaching, and the agreed change of the EP’s [European Parliament&#8217;s] presidency from the S&amp;D to the EPP, important personnel decisions need to be made by the Group in the coming months,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The timeline for designating the EPP’s candidate for Parliament’s Presidency will be decided shortly by the Group and Chairman Weber will also indicate this week what his own role will be in that process.”</p>



<p>Merging group and party leadership would allow Weber to unify two entities that have been at odds on some issues. As group president, he would continue to oversee and coordinate the passing of EU legislation and as party head, he could work to strengthen the EPP&#8217;s tight network of prime ministers and party leaders. </p>



<p>Other politicians have held both roles, notably Wilfried Martens, a former Belgian prime minister who was president of the EPP from 1990 to 2013, while serving as chairman of the parliamentary group from 1994 to 1999.</p>



<p>“EPP members think that the EPP group should be closer to the Council and prime ministers and that having one president for the group and party could bridge the divide between the two,” the EPP official said. “The party and group have been at odds on many files, including migration.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Debacle has exposed severe European failings on multiple fronts — but no agreement on how to fix them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The 20-year, U.S.-led effort to turn Afghanistan into a stable, democratic country failed. But when it comes to the political and policy implications for the EU, a different F-word comes to mind. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the days since the West’s bailout from Kabul, the 27 member countries and the EU institutions in Brussels have been confronting the humiliating reality of their collective lack of military capability and they have been grasping desperately for policy options, some of which seem wildly unrealistic or woefully insufficient.</p>



<p>The inability to keep the Kabul airport functioning, and maintain evacuations, even for just a few days longer without help from the U.S. has led to a sobering conclusion: The European Union can neither protect, nor project, its so-called “European way of life.”</p>



<p>For the 21 EU countries that are also members of NATO, the willingness to simply go along with U.S. decisions about Afghanistan, including former President Donald Trump’s so-called “peace deal” with the Taliban — in some cases despite strong misgivings —&nbsp;has now led to painful questions about whether other allies can even think, let alone fight, independently of Washington.</p>



<p>Of course, the EU’s lack of hard-power capability is nothing new, but it is also just one component of the Afghanistan debacle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1814391" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1320x880.jpg 1320w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-714x476.jpg 714w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1160x773.jpg 1160w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-380x253.jpg 380w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-90x60.jpg 90w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-104x69.jpg 104w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-200x133.jpg 200w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-390x260.jpg 390w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-54x36.jpg 54w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-333x222.jpg 333w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-1120x747.jpg 1120w, https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05/GettyImages-1337477538-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>An Afghan refugee at the Luigi Fenoglio Center in Turin | Stefano S. Guidi/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Fears of a new wave of refugees has put yet another harsh spotlight on the EU’s failure to develop a workable asylum policy, and it has led to a panicked rush to offer financial incentives to countries closer to Afghanistan, including historically unfriendly governments <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/afghanistan-pakistan-europe-crisis-refugees-trade/">like Pakistan</a>, to manage any migration flows.</p>



<p>Adding to European dismay is the inescapable admission that the soft-power initiatives in Afghanistan that the EU regards as a hallmark of its global diplomacy, such as promoting education and the rights of women and girls, are all but certain to crumble under the Taliban’s renewed theocratic rule.</p>



<p>“The rest of Europe is indeed in pretty deep depression now,” said Roland Freudenstein, policy director of the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies, the in-house think tank of the center-right European People’s Party, which has dominated the EU’s leadership for decades.</p>



<p>He said a possible exception was France, which ended its military operations in Afghanistan in 2014 and began evacuating Afghans working for the French embassy and other French organizations in May, months before the U.S. and other NATO allies. </p>



<p>Freudenstein said the widespread gloom reflected the dashed hopes that despite corruption in the Western-backed Afghan government, despite the weakness of the Afghan security forces, somehow the mission could succeed.</p>



<p>“Sure enough there were people who warned about this,” he said. “There were people who didn’t want to see the writing on the wall. There were people who were deluding themselves.”</p>



<p>While some leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have said the experience in Afghanistan confirms the need for a conversation about European “strategic autonomy,” independent experts and analysts say the discussion that&#8217;s really needed is about basic strategic functionality,&nbsp;given the evidence that Europe cannot defend itself, especially if it faced conflict against military powers like Russia or China.</p>



<p>Meetings last week among EU defense ministers and foreign ministers were little more than directionless group therapy sessions. A tentative, guarded decision by foreign ministers to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-afghanistan-taliban-negotiation-conditions-outreach-plan/">set benchmarks</a> for engaging with the Taliban, and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-hesitancy-on-military-force-enhancement-remains-after-afghanistan-europe/">continuing reluctance</a> among defense ministers to bolster EU military capabilities, only added to a pervasive sense that Brussels is dysfunctional and powerless, and unlikely to learn much from the mistakes in Afghanistan.</p>



<h2>Words without action</h2>



<p>Senior officials clearly feel compelled to talk about Afghanistan while having little or nothing to offer in the form of concrete proposals —&nbsp;a point evidenced in a lengthy written statement issued by European Council President Charles Michel. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“As a global economic and democratic power, can Europe be content with a situation where it is unable to ensure unassisted the safety and evacuation of its diplomats, its citizens and those who have helped them and are therefore under threat?” Michel <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/news/2021/09/02/20210902-pec-newsletter-afghanistan/" target="_blank">wrote</a>. “What other major geopolitical event do we need to lead Europe to aim for more decision-making autonomy and capacity for action?”</p>



<p>Michel declared that Europe must reduce its reliance on the U.S. but offered no concrete proposals, writing, “the necessity to reduce our dependencies and strengthen our strategic autonomy is more and more apparent.” And he insisted that Europe must respond quickly — “Europe must rapidly make choices connected to its strategic interests” but has expressed reluctance to put Afghanistan on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled EU leaders’ summit in October.</p>

<p>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has gone a bit further, for example by lending support, in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/opinion/afghanistan-europe-nato.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a> published in the New York Times, to the idea of creating a 5,000-strong European “initial entry force.” But in Brussels, the idea has gained little traction, and Borrell’s article was mostly a lament of Europe’s failures in Afghanistan, combined with a bit of finger-pointing at the U.S.</p>



<p>“In the end, the timing and nature of the withdrawal were set in Washington,” he wrote. “We Europeans found ourselves — not only for the evacuations out of the Kabul airport but also more broadly — depending on American decisions.”</p>



<p>“That should serve as a wake-up call for anyone who cares about the Atlantic alliance,” Borrell continued. “The United States understandably does not want to do everything alone. To become a more capable ally, Europe must invest more in its security capabilities and develop the ability to think and act in strategic terms. The events in Afghanistan have been harrowing. But they should lead us to deepen, not divide, the alliance with America. And to strengthen our cooperation, Europe must step up.”</p>



<p>But Europe only seems to be retreating into a defensive crouch and, when it comes to refugees, its clear instinct is to pay up rather than step up.</p>



<p>The widespread reluctance in most EU capitals to accept significant numbers of refugees has led to bitter internal divisions. At the same time, the asylum debate has exposed the ugly, selfish motivations that often underly the use of soft-power tools like humanitarian assistance and development aid.</p>



<p>To keep refugees away from Europe, top officials have proposed <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-plans-afghanistan-neighbors-host-refugees/">a cascade of financial assistance</a> —&nbsp;some would call it pay-off money — for countries bordering Afghanistan. Governments that stand to benefit from this windfall include Pakistan, which leaders like Michel are now embracing as a partner despite evidence that Islamabad long aided the Taliban’s fight against the West.</p>



<h2>Geopolitical reality check</h2>



<p>In terms of the EU’s broader foreign policy objectives, the implications are similarly chastening.</p>



<p>If two decades of huge military and economic investment in Afghanistan could not create a durable framework for democracy, human rights and rule of law there, there seems to be little chance that more moderate pressure like economic sanctions will change the facts on the ground in Belarus, occupied Ukraine, Syria, or Iran, let alone break the grip of authoritarian regimes in Beijing or Moscow.</p>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who came into office proclaiming her plan to lead a “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/meet-ursula-von-der-leyen-geopolitical-commission/">geopolitical Commission</a>,” participated in an emergency G7 leaders’ meeting about Afghanistan on August 24 and has pledged increased humanitarian assistance. But she has said little to nothing about the situation in the country since condemning the terror attack on the Kabul airport on August 26.</p>



<p>At NATO, the unraveling of the Afghanistan mission stands to become a major stain on the legacy of Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, now entering what is widely expected to be his last year as the alliance’s top civilian leader.</p>



<p>EU foreign ministers now trying to figure out if — and how — to deal with Afghanistan’s new Taliban leadership are mostly the very same foreign ministers who agreed during a NATO meeting in April with Secretary of State Antony Blinken to support President Joe Biden’s decision on a full withdrawal, even though many allies privately voiced anger over Biden&#8217;s lack of substantive consultation. </p>



<p>Standing with Blinken at NATO headquarters in April, Stoltenberg declared: “Today, we decided together on the future of our presence in Afghanistan.”</p>



<p>Stoltenberg had long insisted that any withdrawal would be “conditions-based” but in the end, other allies deferred to Washington, even though many had misgivings about Trump’s deal with the Taliban, in which he cut Afghan President Ashraf Ghani out of the negotiations and agreed to a fixed deadline for the withdrawal of all foreign troops.</p>



<p>“Clearly, public debate is accusing those very foreign ministers of not speaking up,” Freudenstein said. “This goes from domestic debates within countries, where the opposition would accuse the government of deluding themselves — we have this in Germany, for example — to the international debate where European foreign ministers stand accused, or defense ministers stand accused, of not speaking up against the United States.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UK prime minister says 'no veteran’s request for help will go unanswered' as MPs warn of mental health problems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — Boris Johnson will offer an extra £5 million to help charities supporting veterans Monday as he faces another parliamentary grilling on the crisis in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The prime minister will vow to &#8220;use every economic, political and diplomatic lever to protect our country from harm and help the Afghan people&#8221; in a House of Commons statement,  Downing Street said.</p>



<p>And he will thank the 150,000 British servicemen and women for their service over the past two decades of conflict as he promises &#8220;no veteran’s request for help will go unanswered.&#8221;</p>



<p>The promise of extra help to veterans&#8217; charities comes after criticism from Johnson&#8217;s former defense minister and ex-soldier Johnny Mercer, who served three tours of Afghanistan but <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-minister-sacked-amid-row-over-northern-ireland-troubles-prosecutions/">dramatically left government earlier this year</a> claiming it was &#8220;consistently failing&#8221; to support former soldiers properly.</p>



<p>Mercer warned in a special debate last month that ministers should prepare for a &#8220;bow wave&#8221; of mental health issues among veterans following the allied forces&#8217; withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The Tory former minister told the House of Commons: &#8220;The prime minister must not wriggle out of his commitments on this issue. The Office for Veterans Affairs is nothing like it was designed to be and he knows that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Downing Street said the funding would be made available&nbsp;to charities so they could increase capacity in mental health support, and make it easier for veterans to understand and access the support already available to them through the state and charities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Inauguration of bishop the latest flashpoint in a long-running dispute.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Tensions in Montenegro reached fever pitch at the weekend as protesters and police clashed over the inauguration of an orthodox bishop amid continued division over church independence.</p>



<p>A large group barricaded the road from the capital Podgorica to the city of Cetinje on Saturday, trying to prevent the patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC), Porfirije, and Bishop Joanikije from attending the latter’s inauguration as the new head (known as a metropolitan) of the Montenegrin branch of the SOC.</p>



<p>On Sunday morning in Cetinje, hundreds of protesters clashed with riot police who used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Around 40 citizens and 20 policemen were injured, according to <a href="https://balkans.aljazeera.net/news/balkan/2021/9/5/policija-intervenisala-bacen-suzavac-na-protestima-u-cetinju" target="_blank">local media</a>.</p>



<p>The metropolitan and the patriarch had to be flown into Cetinje on Sunday by military helicopter, under heavy police protection. Scenes of the church delegation leaving the helicopter covered by an anti-bullet kevlar blanket quickly swept the region.</p>



<p>“These incidents are the result of a clear weaponization and politicization of the church on both sides,” said former ambassador to NATO and political scientist Vesko Garčević.</p>



<p>The small Balkan country has been split over the role of the church for almost two years since the previous government led by the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) agreed to transfer church property from the SOC to the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, whose independence is not recognized<strong> </strong>by&nbsp;the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the main Eastern Orthodox authority.</p>



<p>DPS lost an election last August to current Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapić’s For the Future of Montenegro bloc, but the tensions have not subsided.</p>



<p>“I call, again, on all socio-political actors to maintain peace, which is the most valuable thing now,” Krivokapić said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/profKrivokapic/status/1434108803994296321?s=20" target="_blank">tweet</a> on Saturday. The PM, whose election success was largely based on rallying against an independent Montenegrin church, has significantly toned down his nationalist rhetoric in the past year, leading him to lose the support of many hardliners.</p>



<p>Montenegro was the last former Yugoslav republic to split from Serbia, with which it shared a government until 2006. Some on the Serbian side claim that the church split was a political move to put distance between the two countries.</p>



<p>Others — notably President Milo Đukanović, who is also head of the DPS&nbsp;—&nbsp;claim the church split allowed Montenegro to emerge from Serbia’s shadow.</p>



<p>Montenegro is less ethnically homogenous than its neighbors. In the last census in 2011, 45 percent of the population declared themselves ethnic Montenegrin, while 28 percent said they were ethnic Serbs. The rest are part of minorities such as ethnic Albanians and Bosniaks.</p>



<p>“The concept of a multiethnic Montenegro of its citizens, which was strong at the moment when the country declared independence, is now significantly weakened by people being tied to one church over another,” said Garčević.</p>



<p>The SOC continues to own most church property in Montenegro, including the Monastery of St Basil, dedicated to the country’s most revered saint. The decision to hold the ceremony in Cetinje, which was once the royal seat of the country and the center of its independence efforts, was seen as a provocation and a show of force by the SOC.</p>



<p>The last metropolitan, Amfilohije, who passed away in October last year due to COVID-19, was inaugurated in Cetinje in 1991. At the time, Serbian warlord Željko Ražnatović Arkan was guarding the Monastery of St Basil and Amfilohije<a href="https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/srpska_pravoslavna_crkva_amfilohije_karadzic_mladic/24093460.html" target="_blank"> admitted being friends</a> with Bosnian Serb politician Radovan Karadžić, who was later convicted of genocide.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, the violent means used by the protesters in Cetinje overshadowed the legitimate reasons and revulsion felt by people in Montenegro with the inauguration being held in Cetinje,” said Garčević.</p>

<p>BERLIN — Germany wants talks with the Taliban on flying its remaining local workers out of Afghanistan, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday.</p>



<p>&#8220;We need to talk to the Taliban about how we can continue to get people who worked for Germany out of the country and to safety,&#8221; Merkel said during a visit to the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia.</p>



<p>On Friday, EU foreign ministers <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-afghanistan-taliban-negotiation-conditions-outreach-plan/">agreed</a> an outreach plan with the Taliban but that doesn&#8217;t mean the bloc is about to recognize them as the legitimate Afghan government.</p>



<p>Merkel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyiEtAEOTuU" target="_blank">said</a> the Taliban &#8220;are now the ones who have to be addressed.&#8221;</p>



<p>The German government <a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/-/2478478" target="_blank">says</a> it has so far been able to fly 5,300 people out of Kabul airport, including 530 German citizens and 4,400 Afghan nationals.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, White House chief of staff Ron Klain <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/05/americans-left-afghanistan-klain-509730" target="_blank">said</a> Sunday that there are still around 100 U.S. nationals left in Afghanistan and that efforts to evacuate them and more Afghans were continuing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chief of staff Ron Klain said the administration is still looking at ways to get them out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Sunday that there are around 100 American citizens left in Afghanistan, days after the administration’s Aug. 31 deadline for getting them all out.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re in touch with all of them who we&#8217;ve identified on a regular basis,” Klain said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”</p>



<p>The administration is “hopeful that in the coming days the Qataris will be able to resume air service out of Kabul. If they do, we&#8217;re obviously going to look to see if Americans can be part of those flights,&#8221; he said, referring to the nation of Qatar.</p>



<p>Klain also said that the administration, which ended the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, is “in close communication with our sources and our contacts in Afghanistan to try to get [Afghan] SIVs out safely,” following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/01/afghanistan-sivs-left-behind-state-dept-508327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports that the majority of applicants for Special Immigrant Visas have been left behind and that some have been targeted by the Taliban</a>.</p>



<p>“I know some are coming out by land,” he added. “We are continuing to work on efforts to get them out by air as well. We&#8217;re going to continue to move those SIVs out of the country.”</p>



<p>The administration is working to resettle those who have already been evacuated from the country too, he noted.</p>



<p>&#8220;We launched a historic airlift that brought 124,000 people out of Afghanistan, American citizens, legal permanent residents of this country, residents of other countries, and a lot of Afghan nationals,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ultimately going to resettle them in Europe and the United States, and that&#8217;s a big part of rescuing that SIV population.”</p>
