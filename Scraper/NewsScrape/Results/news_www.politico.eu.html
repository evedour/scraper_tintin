					<description><![CDATA[The UK foreign secretary arrives in Qatar just hours after being grilled by MPs on how he handled the Afghanistan crisis. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab landed in Qatar early Thursday morning, for talks with the country&#8217;s emir and foreign minister, in order to secure safe passage out of Afghanistan for the thousands of people with U.K. ties left behind.</p>



<p>Raab will hold face-to-face talks with the Emir of Qatar&nbsp;Sheikh&nbsp;Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani&nbsp;and Foreign Minister&nbsp;Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, in hopes that Qatar, with its close links to the Taliban leadership,&nbsp;will be&nbsp;instrumental in reestablishing a functioning airport in Kabul. </p>



<p>&#8220;The decision to visit Doha first on a trip to the region reflects the high profile role the Qataris have played with regard to Afghanistan in recent years, including hosting the Taliban political office in Doha since 2013,&#8221; the Foreign Office said last night.</p>



<p>U.K. sources told POLITICO&#8217;s London Playbook that Qatar was crucial in working with the Taliban to enable the British evacuation mission.</p>



<p>On his visit, the foreign secretary will be briefed on the outcome of talks in Doha between British officials and Taliban leaders which have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-travels-to-qatar-for-talks-on-security-and-safe-passage-for-afghans" target="_blank">already</a> begun.</p>



<p>Doha is expected to be the first stop for Raab on a tour of the region over the next few days, as the foreign secretary escapes a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/5-takeaways-dominic-raab-afghanistan/">whirlwind of criticism</a> back home over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis. Raab&#8217;s arrival in Doha came just hours after he was under fire from MPs on the Commons foreign affairs committee about the U.K.&#8217;s exit from Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The Foreign Office confirmed that the British embassy in Afghanistan was moved out of Kabul last week and is now <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-travels-to-qatar-for-talks-on-security-and-safe-passage-for-afghans" target="_blank">fully operational</a> in Doha.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The outlets targeted include POLITICO Europe. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sixteen European civil society organizations said Thursday they would no longer attend media events sponsored by fossil fuel companies and hosted by POLITICO Europe, the Financial Times or Euractiv.</p>



<p>The fossil fuel industry is “buying a platform to gain credibility and undue influence” through such sponsorships, the organizations wrote in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yoDU3jKP7ErpGzIDOCDnpSA91XKofLFkC-2NYQms-pY/edit" target="_blank">joint letter</a> to the media organizations.</p>



<p>POLITICO regularly hosts events on EU policy, and some have been sponsored by firms such as oil giant Shell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NGOs — which include Corporate Europe Observatory, the European Federation of Public Service Unions, Greenpeace and Transport &amp; Environment, among others —&nbsp;are calling on the three media outlets to drop fossil fuel firms as sponsors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they are also lobbying policymakers not to attend events sponsored by such companies, said Lala Hakuma Dadci of Fossil Free Politics, a coalition of campaign groups that coordinated the statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We call on media to stop this practice —&nbsp;but also on policymakers not to participate when invited,” she said. “As the fossil fuel industry is responsible for a large part of the climate crisis, they don’t have any space in today’s debate. It’s a conflict of interest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three outlets named in the letter, she added, were chosen because they had recently hosted events related to EU climate or energy policy, sponsored by fossil fuel companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pascoe Sabido, a campaigner at Corporate Europe Observatory, said the letter was part of a broader effort to construct a “firewall” between EU policymakers and the fossil fuel industry, given what he called the “irreconcilable conflict of interest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NGOs&#8217; complaint is not about the content being produced by the media outlets, Sabido added. “It’s about who can afford a voice. The fossil fuel industry is buying itself a voice, buying itself legitimacy —&nbsp;we need to take that away if we want to tackle the climate crisis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>German Green MEP Reinhard Bütikofer said he was not aware of having previously attended any events funded by fossil fuel firms. “But if such sponsorship has actually occurred at POLITICO, I will specifically ask about it in the future. And cancel if necessary.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for POLITICO Europe stressed that event sponsors have no influence on the organization’s editorial content and that “the objectivity, independence and integrity applied to our coverage … also apply to our POLITICO Live events.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They added that the company is &#8220;neither judge nor jury&#8221; on policy debates and does not endorse &#8220;causes or entities.&#8221; </p>



<p>The NGOs’ decision not to participate in events is “their prerogative,” the spokesperson said, but added that it was “a pity that they would choose not to represent their point of view&#8221; and expressed hope they would reconsider. </p>



<p>Euractiv and the Financial Times had not responded to requests for comment as of Wednesday evening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Shell, which sponsors a series of energy policy events hosted by POLITICO Europe, said in response to the letter that the company &#8220;advocates for an enabling EU policy framework to accelerate the deployment of low carbon technologies needed to meet the EU’s climate targets,&#8221; and added that the event series &#8220;aims to provide a platform for dialogue on the EU’s transition to climate neutrality among all stakeholders.&#8221;</p>



<p>Scrutiny of news organizations’ fossil fuel industry-linked revenue has been growing both in Europe and the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness <a href="https://www.fossilfreepolitics.org/news-resources/why-were-not-attending-the-financial-times-hydrogen-summit" target="_blank">decided</a> to boycott a Financial Times event sponsored by Uniper, as the energy company was suing the Dutch government over the country’s planned coal phaseout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the United States, campaigners <a href="https://adsnotfittoprint.com/" target="_blank">are trying</a> to pressure the New York Times to drop fossil fuel advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A handful of news outlets, like the Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/29/guardian-to-ban-advertising-from-fossil-fuel-firms-climate-crisis" target="_blank">have decided</a> to no longer accept money from fossil fuel firms.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Concern over global warming is reopening the debate about shutting down nuclear power plants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This is the second chapter in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.eu/the-road-to-cop26-climate-change-glasgow/">The Road to COP26</a>&nbsp;series.</em></p>



<p>Nuclear power has some really big problems, which is why many EU countries are shutting down their reactors — but the accelerating pace of climate change is prompting second thoughts.</p>



<p>There is growing queasiness in parts of Europe over plans by <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/energie-environnement/nucleaire-edf-donne-la-liste-des-centrales-qui-vont-arreter-des-reacteurs-1164755" target="_blank">France</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1633764">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1107364">Spain</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1071024">Belgium</a> to shut down 32 nuclear reactors, representing 31.9 GW of CO2-free electricity capacity, by 2035.</p>



<p>“We can’t afford to shut down nuclear because we’re going to build more coal like Germany has done over the last 15 years — frankly to its shame,&#8221; said Sean Kidney, CEO of Climate Bonds Initiative and a member of the European Commission’s advisory Platform on Sustainable Finance. &#8220;Emissions reduction is a critical metric, you can’t discount something just because you don’t like it.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s a wave of enthusiasm for building new nuclear capacity in Western Europe — but the climate cost of shutting down plants instead of squeezing more years of operation out of them is increasingly acute. That&#8217;s highlighted by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/" target="_blank">grim warnings</a> from climate scientists about the dwindling amount of CO2 the world can afford to emit in the next decade. </p>



<p>&#8220;Some of those reactors are in good enough shape for regulators to authorize an extension, with the necessary maintenance and security precautions, for two, five, 10 years,&#8221; European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton <a href="https://youtu.be/XcbsyIruViY?t=1847" target="_blank">said</a> Friday at an annual business conference, adding: &#8220;Why deprive ourselves of this production capacity?&#8221;</p>



<p>That line of thinking mirrors <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ad5a93ce-3a7f-461d-a441-8a05b7601887/Nuclear_Power_in_a_Clean_Energy_System.pdf" target="_blank">recommendations</a> from the International Energy Agency to &#8220;authorize lifetime extensions of existing nuclear plants for as long as safely possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>A very small but growing movement to rethink nuclear shutdowns is bolstering that idea.</p>



<p>On September 11, a &#8220;<a href="http://standupfornuclear.be/" target="_blank">Stand Up for Nuclear</a>&#8221; demonstration pitching the atom as a decarbonization solution is scheduled to take place in Brussels. </p>



<p>This summer, regular tiny demonstrations organized by <a href="https://nuklearia.de/" target="_blank">Nuklearia</a> and <a href="https://critical-climate-action.de/mothers-for-nuclear-dach/" target="_blank">Mothers for Nuclear Germany-Austria-Switzerland</a> <a href="https://critical-climate-action.de/demo-termine-2021/" target="_blank">were held </a>at Germany&#8217;s six remaining reactors, calling for a reversal of the policy to shut them down by the end of next year. The groups cite opinion <a href="https://nuklearia.de/2021/06/16/umfragen-mehrheit-der-deutschen-will-kernkraft-fuer-den-klimaschutz-2/" target="_blank">polls</a> showing declining, albeit still majority, support for the phaseout.</p>



<p>&#8220;We need both nuclear and renewables in order to phase out fossil fuels — our political message and top priority is to save the six remaining reactors in order to avoid emissions of 70 million tons of CO2 each year,&#8221; said Rainer Klute, volunteer chairman of Nuklearia who works in IT and data protection by day.</p>



<p>So far that pressure hasn&#8217;t changed any national policies.</p>



<p>Germany is sticking with its <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1633764">plan</a> to close down its nuclear plants — a process sped up by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>Belgium also still aims to close down its reactors; a <a href="https://www.lecho.be/actualite/archive/electrabel-veut-la-clarte-sur-le-nucleaire/10203038" target="_blank">request</a> by utility Electrabel to extend the lives of several by another 20 years was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-belgium-government-idUKKBN26L14L" target="_blank">nixed</a> by the government last year. Instead, Belgium is preparing an <a href="https://www.elia.be/en/electricity-market-and-system/adequacy/capacity-remuneration-mechanism" target="_blank">auction</a> in October to <a href="https://www.elia.be/en/electricity-market-and-system/adequacy/capacity-remuneration-mechanism" target="_blank">replace</a> the first nuclear reactor to turn off with a fleet of gas-fired plants. </p>

<p>Last week, a group of nuclear engineers <a href="https://horizon238.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Letter-to-the-government-Belgiums-energy-future.pdf" target="_blank">published</a> an open letter to Prime Minister Alexander De Croo asking for a reconsideration<strong>. </strong></p>



<p>&#8220;The construction of new gas-fired power plants will probably be necessary, yet extending the most recent nuclear reactors could still reduce their number,&#8221; the letter reads.</p>



<p>France <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-electricity-source-stacked?stackMode=relative&amp;country=CHE~DEU~SWE~FRA" target="_blank">gets</a> more than two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear — giving it the lowest emissions of any major economy. That&#8217;s a stark contrast with Germany, where nuclear generates 11 percent of power, while fossil fuels account for 44 percent — 24 percent of that from coal.</p>



<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is sticking with his promise to reduce the nuclear share in the power mix to 50 percent by 2035, but he has yet to decide whether to invest in replacing the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1623699">oldest reactors</a> with a new generation of very expensive and technologically troubled European Pressurized Reactors, like the one now under construction in Flamanville.</p>



<h3>Atomic angst</h3>



<p>Rethinking nuclear is happening elsewhere in the bloc.</p>



<p>Sweden&#8217;s decision to halt nuclear expansion after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the U.S. — and shut off reactors by 2010 — was deferred as demand for clean power rose. Nuclear now generates 42 percent of electricity — and expanding that share is a lively part of the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-nuclear-power-split/">debate</a> ahead of next year&#8217;s parliamentary election.</p>



<p>In Spain, the Socialist government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-energy-idUSKCN1Q212W" target="_blank">announced</a> in 2019 that it would switch off the country’s seven nuclear reactors between 2025 and 2035, with the goal of relying fully on renewables by mid-century. But this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1794425">soaring power prices</a>, caused largely by spikes in natural gas and EU carbon prices, are drawing public attention to the nuclear power that provides one-fifth of the country&#8217;s electricity.</p>



<p>The conservative opposition People&#8217;s Party <a href="https://twitter.com/pablocasado_/status/1429771705908703236" target="_blank">thinks</a> that should prompt a reassessment of &#8220;clean, cheap and safe&#8221; nuclear power if national regulators determine lifetime extensions beyond 2035 are possible.</p>



<p>Nuclear still has outright advocates in the EU. France, Slovakia and Finland are building new plants, with nuclear plans in various stages of preparation in the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. </p>



<p>In Italy, newly appointed Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani <a href="https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2021/05/19/news/-2415400/" target="_blank">suggested</a> this spring that his country — which has twice rejected nuclear by popular referendum —&nbsp;consider futuristic small modular reactors (SMRs) when they become available.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should the European Commission consider it a source of clean energy, it would be our duty to have a discussion and consider mini-reactors &#8230; leaving aside any ideology,&#8221; said Cingolani, a physicist by training.</p>



<p>SMRs are being touted in other countries as a potential way to build cheaper nuclear power stations that could provide a low, stable base of electricity to undergird fluctuating renewables, without the massive price tag and construction time of a full-sized unit.</p>



<p>The Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/events/first-eu-workshop-small-modular-reactors-2021-jun-29_en" target="_blank">convened</a> a closed-door workshop on SMRs this summer to hear the latest updates from the industry.<strong> </strong>It will decide whether to include nuclear in its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en" target="_blank">taxonomy</a> list of sustainable investments before the fall.</p>



<p>&#8220;In nuclear, just accept that what’s there is low-carbon, separate it from new nuclear. I sort of think we need to accept renovation and maintenance of existing nuclear,&#8221; said Kidney.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Forests absorb about 10 percent of the EU's CO2 emissions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This is the second chapter in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.eu/the-road-to-cop26-climate-change-glasgow/">The Road to COP26</a>&nbsp;series.</em></p>



<p>Growing worries about the speed and scale of climate change are prompting a look at technologies ranging from nuclear to sci-fi schemes like space mirrors. But there&#8217;s one system that&#8217;s been doing a pretty good job of pulling carbon from the atmosphere for the last 360 million years: trees.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s made forests a favored low-tech way of combating global warming — including by the European Union, which calls for planting <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/forests/swd_3bn_trees.pdf" target="_blank">3 billion trees</a> by 2030 as part of its effort to cut CO2 emissions by 55 percent by that year.  </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a risky gamble as those trees are in danger from some of the consequences of climate change, including increasing wildfires, droughts and pests. And trees that burn or die end up releasing their captured CO2 back into the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“European forests have been removing CO2 for many years,” said Peter Iversen, forests and climate expert at the European Environment Agency (EEA), but “we see a decline” in the last five years. “They are removing less than before.”</p>


<script>!function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a="script",s="InfogramEmbeds",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf("file")&&(i="http:"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement("div");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js","7a87b944-9ded-4282-ab08-3652e5609cbf","interactive","");</script>



<p>The bloc’s forests currently absorb about 10 percent of the EU’s CO2 emissions. But Iversen said that “some countries have been suffering from insect infestations, in particular bark beetles” and “that has cost them some forests, removals and even sometimes led to net emissions [increases].”</p>



<p>Those problems mean the EU&#8217;s tree-planting program “needs to be done properly,” Iversen said. “There [are] a lot of things to think about before planting trees,” including finding the right place and the right species adapted to the local ecosystem and considering the effects of climate change to ensure the trees stand for as long as possible.</p>



<p>But planting trees isn&#8217;t a panacea and should be part of a broader strategy linked to drastic emissions reductions, said Katia Prassoloff, customer sustainability and communications manager at <a href="https://www.reforestaction.com/en/#0" target="_blank">Reforest&#8217;Action</a>. Massive afforestation projects can also create <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292787818_Conflicts_caused_by_afforestation_of_agricultural_lands_in_densely_populated_areas" target="_blank">tensions</a> over whether land should be used for forests or farming.</p>



<p>Another question is whether EU countries will have the capacity to breed enough young trees. </p>



<p>“There was an extraordinary scenario at the last British election when every political party was promising to plant more trees, offset and reach net zero emissions &#8230; ignoring the fact that this would require a huge number of imported trees,” said Matthew Orman, executive director of the Sustainable Soils Alliance, a not-for-profit company based in the U.K.</p>

<h3>Carbon credit questions</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s not just governments planting trees. Many corporate carbon credit plans finance tree planting as a way of offsetting their emissions.</p>



<p>But such schemes “should only be used as a complement, to offset your unavoidable emissions,” said Prassoloff, whose company links local initiatives with businesses willing to buy carbon credits, but only after they have done their utmost to reduce their emissions. </p>



<p>She warned that “offsetting doesn’t mean erasing your impact,” adding that she encourages companies to avoid saying they’re carbon neutral because “it sends the wrong message unless you really have zero emissions.”</p>



<p>Planting trees is also not a miracle cure for emissions being pumped into the atmosphere today. It takes decades for a seedling to grow into a mature tree that <a href="https://greenearthappeal.org/co2-verification/" target="_blank">absorbs</a> about 30 kilograms of carbon a year.</p>



<p>“The element of time is often forgotten when talking about the carbon balance of forests,” said German Green MEP Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg, who has a background in environmental science and forest management. “Yes, in the end, forests will be carbon neutral, but not before 80 or 100 years, and we can’t wait that much time.”</p>



<p>And once planted, trees face risks from fires — something that&#8217;s devastated forests from <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-wildfires-summer-2021-athens/">Greece</a> to Scandinavia, Siberia and western North America this summer. The latest <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362" target="_blank">report</a> by the U.N.&#8217;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds &#8220;more frequent occurrence of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves&#8221; are likely, with a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ipcc-climate-change-warnings-europe/">prediction</a> that fire weather conditions will increase in much of Europe.</p>



<p>“If fires’ frequency and intensity increase it will be negative for the capacity of forests [to absorb CO2] because they won’t have the time to regrow,” Iversen warned.</p>


<script>!function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a="script",s="InfogramEmbeds",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf("file")&&(i="http:"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement("div");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js","4b8ff2bc-d2cc-46b7-bd30-acefcbea2802","interactive","");</script>



<p>In the United States, some carbon removal programs, where landowners are incentivized to manage their land to maximize carbon storage, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/us/wildfires-carbon-offsets.html" target="_blank">have already gone up in flames</a> — including ones <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f89c759-eb9a-4dfb-b768-d4af1ec5aa23" target="_blank">supported</a> by BP and Microsoft to offset their emissions.</p>



<p>Prassoloff said that so far none of the projects Reforest&#8217;Action manages in France or in Brazil have been hit by fires but conceded that resilience to climate change and fires is a risk that the company is increasingly considering when selecting projects to fund.</p>



<p>One way of insuring carbon removal projects against the impact of fires is so-called buffer accounts. </p>



<p>“A certain quantity of the carbon credits that are generated by each project is kept on a specific account and cannot be sold to companies for offsetting,” Prassoloff said. “It is used in case the forest project is destroyed &#8230; The idea is to take into account the risk of the sequestered carbon being re-emitted into the atmosphere in case there is a fire or another type of hazard that can damage the forest.” </p>



<p>How forests are managed can also increase or decrease their absorption capacity. The European Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0572" target="_blank">Forest Strategy </a>has set off a political fight over how to balance the use of forests to absorb carbon and protect biodiversity with economic interests such as logging and energy use.</p>



<p>Some practices are bad both for the climate and for trees’ capacity to absorb CO2, like <a href="https://you.wemove.eu/campaigns/stop-clear-cutting-european-forests" target="_blank">clear-cutting</a> large areas, said Deparnay-Grunenberg.</p>



<p>“Forest soil is like a sponge,” she said. It absorbs water but also CO2, and helps prevent drought and erosion. “But if we clear cut an area, the soil gets hard and cannot retain water anymore.”</p>



<p>“We don’t want to not touch forests at all anymore, but we need truly sustainable forest management,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The clandestine operation resulted in the successful evacuation of hundreds of American citizens and vulnerable Afghans.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As the Biden administration scrambled to conduct a massive evacuation effort from Afghanistan, American officials quietly instructed U.S. citizens and at-risk Afghans, including Afghan commandos, to head to a secret CIA base outside Kabul to secure safe passage to the U.S. amid increased risks of a terrorist attack on the capital city’s main airport.</p>



<p>The clandestine operation, which took place over several weeks in August, resulted in the successful evacuation of hundreds of American citizens and vulnerable Afghans, including members of the elite Afghan special forces and their family members. At least 1,000 Afghan commandos and their family members were evacuated in the overall U.S. effort.</p>



<p>The details of the operation are based on documents provided to POLITICO and conversations with a senior administration official, a defense official and a congressional official, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.</p>



<p>A U.S. official confirmed the CIA’s involvement in the evacuation, noting that the agency “worked closely with other agencies to facilitate in various ways access to the airport for American citizens and Afghans at risk.”</p>



<p>The New York Times&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/world/asia/cia-afghanistan-evacuations-demolitions.html" target="_blank">first reported that the U.S used the base</a>&nbsp;for evacuations. The full scope of the operation in the final days of the evacuation effort, however, has not been previously reported. A CIA spokesperson declined to comment on the operation.</p>



<p>At least some of the evacuees were taken by air from the secret compound, known as Eagle Base, to the airport in order to bypass the chaotic crowds and terror threat around the gates. Several helicopter flights operated by a U.S. company flew from an area around Eagle Base to the Kabul airport beginning on Aug. 15, when the Taliban took control of the city, according to flight data obtained by POLITICO.</p>



<p>Flight data suggests some of the evacuees were flown to Germany. During that same time period, aircraft owned by a U.S. government contractor flew from the Kabul airport to Ramstein Air Base in Germany.</p>



<p>The effort was coordinated with U.S. diplomats and staff who were relocated from the embassy to Hamid Karzai International Airport after the Taliban took control of Kabul. The diplomats had been communicating directly with American citizens who were trying to leave Afghanistan but feared for their safety — especially after the embassy publicly urged Americans not to travel to the airport last week amid threats of an attack from the ISIS-K terror group.</p>



<p>The Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations Command was also helping reach out to hundreds of American citizens inside Kabul and around the country.</p>



<p>The House Intelligence Committee was briefed about the operation in August, two of the sources said, as lawmakers from both parties were seeking details from the Biden administration about efforts to evacuate Americans from Afghanistan. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment.</p>



<p>Eagle Base, the sprawling CIA compound located less than three miles north of the airport, has a controversial history. Established early in the Afghanistan conflict at a former brick factory, the base was used by the CIA from 2002 to 2004 for “enhanced interrogation” of terror suspects. The CIA also used it to train Afghan counterterrorism units.</p>



<p>But during the rush to leave Kabul in recent weeks, the compound provided a crucial staging base for evacuees hoping to get out of Afghanistan — before&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/us/politics/cia-base-destroyed-kabul.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was demolished on Aug. 27</a>&nbsp;as part of the effort to ensure that no sensitive equipment or intelligence information would fall into the hands of the Taliban.</p>



<p>As the overall evacuation effort continued, the threat from ISIS-K terrorists to specific gates of the airport was growing. American officials began instructing U.S. citizens to head to different gates to gain entry into the airport for evacuation.</p>



<p>As the threat shifted, officials were “constantly mixing it up,” the defense official said — one day instructing people to head to one gate, and the next day telling them to meet at another location.</p>



<p>American officials were also directing citizens and at-risk Afghans, including commandos, to head to Eagle Base as a safer way station on their way to the airport.</p>



<p>During a call at 4 p.m. on Aug. 25 in Washington, or 12:30 a.m. on Aug. 26 in Kabul, Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, estimated that roughly 1,000 out of 2,000 Afghan commandos slated for evacuation, along with a number of American citizens coming from Eagle Base, had been successfully routed to the airport.</p>



<p>These people got out just in time. Just hours later, at roughly 6 p.m. in Kabul on Aug. 26, an ISIS-K suicide bomber detonated an explosive device just outside the airport, killing 13 American service members and hundreds of Afghans.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Confusion and dissension still cloud efforts to increase EU's defense clout.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Afghanistan had fallen. A rushed extraction effort was hurtling toward an impossible deadline. Many Europeans wanted some more time, but had no choice —&nbsp;the U.S. was leaving.</p>



<p>Inevitably, the questions arose among officials and analysts: Why doesn’t the EU have its own troops to deploy? Why is it relying on the Americans? </p>



<p>It’s a good point, European Council President Charles Michel <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-209936" target="_blank">said last week</a> after an emergency G7 leaders&#8217; videoconference on Afghanistan. Developing the EU’s military capabilities, he argued, is “of the utmost importance for the future of Europe.”</p>



<p>But standing next to him, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen seemed perplexed when, a few minutes later, a journalist asked: What about the top EU diplomat’s proposal to develop a rapid response force of 50,000 European soldiers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have understood you, but I’m not aware of this comment,” she said. She looked over to Michel: “Are you?” There was no reply.</p>



<p>The exchange was emblematic of the confusion and muddled rhetoric that perpetually dominates the recurring EU debate over whether the bloc should increase its military muscle. Each time it becomes apparent that Europe relies on the U.S. militarily, the debate revives across the Continent. And each time, it devolves into a morass of opaque and noncommittal comments that often paper over the practical and political realities.</p>



<p>There are numerous skeptical EU countries —&nbsp;mainly the Baltic and eastern nations. Many officials are also worried about duplicating efforts within the NATO military alliance. Others fear a more assertive EU military plan would simply erode the already-strained EU-U.S. relationship. Additionally, there’s a fractious history within Europe of trying to jointly build military equipment.</p>



<p>Thus far, this moment has been no different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The EU is not a credible substitute for what NATO represents,” said Kristjan Mäe, head of the Estonian Defense Ministry’s NATO and EU Department. “You will not see any appetite for the European army amongst member states.”</p>



<p>Even if the EU did boost its own military capabilities, one diplomat said, “it will be hard to find the consensus to use it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the conversations are happening in the corridors of some EU institutions, particularly within the bloc’s diplomatic arm, the European External Action Service, a senior official said. That organization&#8217;s head, Josep Borrell, has been pushing the idea of an EU rapid response brigade. More broadly, EU powers like Germany and France are supportive of heading in that direction. And some senior defense officials, including those in Portugal and Italy, are urging their colleagues to seriously consider the idea.</p>



<p>On Wednesday and Thursday, EU defense ministers will do just that, as they meet in Slovenia to discuss the fallout from their Afghanistan departure. But don&#8217;t expect quick action.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s going to take some time for member states to digest what happened,” said a senior diplomat.</p>



<h2><strong>Building an EU army?</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the frequent dissension, the EU has actually taken a number of steps in recent years to strengthen its military posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In<a href="https://eda.europa.eu/what-we-do/EU-defence-initiatives/permanent-structured-cooperation-(PESCO)" target="_blank"> 2017</a>, the EU officially launched a military pact known as Permanent Structured Cooperation, or PESCO, aimed at bringing together European countries on everything from drone defense to maritime surveillance. The pact is formally made up of <a href="https://pesco.europa.eu" target="_blank">46 projects,</a> yet many <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/leaked-document-shows-delays-in-eu-military-pact/">face significant delays</a>, raising questions about its effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU is also setting aside an increasing amount of money for collaborative military efforts. For 2021 to 2027, the bloc has earmarked <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/defence-industry-space/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf_it" target="_blank">€8 billion </a>to support joint defense research and development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when the EU’s defense ministers meet in Slovenia this week, they’ll be discussing a “strategic compass” document that will outline the bloc’s military threats and ambitions for the coming years. The goal is to have a first draft by November and unveil the final version at the start of 2022.&nbsp;The strategy document is expected to include some language on the rapid entry force proposal. And part of the discussion is about whether the force can turn into a “European army.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a phrase that remains taboo in many capitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t think it&#8217;s time after Afghanistan to start opening discussions on the future of the European army,” said Jan Havránek, the Czech Republic’s deputy minister of defense. “I mean these are buzzwords.”</p>



<p>The EU already has so-called <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/esdp/91624.pdf" target="_blank">battlegroups</a>, units of roughly 1,500 people on standby that EU countries provide.</p>



<p>But these groups have never been used. The reasons are varied, ranging from the cost to countries’ reluctance to put their soldiers’ lives at risk. That reticence has many arguing any larger EU force —&nbsp;let alone a 50,000-strong unit that could rapidly deploy — is pollyannaish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Give it time, counter those pushing for a robust EU military force. They insist the battlegroups are the beginning of an evolution that will lead to larger forces. And, they note that thanks to a new <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/46286/questions-answers-european-peace-facility_en" target="_blank">€5 billion</a> budget fund for military operations, a true cross-EU force can defray costs better than the individual battlegroups, which so far have been mainly funded by individual countries.</p>



<p>The EU army is &#8220;a thing that must happen&#8221; said Giorgio Mulè, the Italian defense undersecretary.&nbsp;For him, &#8220;a group of nations&#8221; composed of the EU&#8217;s founding countries —&nbsp;Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg —&nbsp;should take the first steps. </p>



<h2><strong>A coalition of the willing?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Proponents of a joint EU defense insist the turbulent end to the Afghan campaign will be a game-changer.</p>



<p>&#8220;We cannot remain adolescents forever,” said Portuguese Defense Minister João Gomes Cravinho in a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/brussels-playbook-eu-must-grow-up-afghanistan-on-the-agenda-defeated-by-belgian-weather/">recent POLITICO interview</a>. “We have to, at a certain point, stand up and say we assume responsibilities. That time has come.&#8221;</p>



<p>But, absent a unified desire for a true EU army, diplomats say a smaller group of European countries may instead decide to just create their own joint force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some European countries, it has long been a dream to establish a more pan-European defense system. In fact, in 1999, EU leaders actually <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/ACFA4C.htm" target="_blank">agreed</a> to develop the 50,000-person rapid response team by 2003.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It never happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, 14 EU countries, including Germany and France, teamed up to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-seeks-rapid-response-military-force-two-decades-after-first-try-2021-05-05/" target="_blank">revive</a> the idea, now suggesting 5,000-person brigades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borrell predicted these countries would eventually move ahead on their own if the EU didn’t get on board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The EU must be able to intervene to protect our interests when the Americans don’t want to be involved,” he said in a recent <a href="https://www.corriere.it/english/21_agosto_30/borrell-afghanistan-was-catastrophe-europe-must-share-responsibility-3c8a0f46-08f2-11ec-92ce-f1aac6dc2317_amp.html?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">interview</a> with Italian daily Corriere della Sera. “If there is no unanimity, sooner or later a group of countries will decide to go ahead on their own as they won’t accept to be stopped.”</p>



<p>Achieving EU unanimity on foreign policy issues — a requirement — has often proven difficult on even small decisions like joint statements. </p>



<p>But while the EU may eventually lower the bar on some foreign policy issues, diplomats are skeptical the EU will strip the unanimity requirement for sending in troops. So if the EU wants to act unanimously, it might remain stuck.</p>



<h2><strong>Can Europe jointly build an army?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>An interesting test case of Europe’s ability to work together militarily is a Franco-German effort to jointly build fighter jets.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-germany-defence-idUSKBN19Y1FJ" target="_blank">Announced</a> in 2017, the project has become viewed as a weathervane for how some European countries feel about such ambitions —&nbsp;and also the challenges they represent. Spain, for instance, later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airshow-europe-fighter-idUSKCN1TI0Z3" target="_blank">joined</a> the project. Cravinho called the construction an “enormously significant flagship project.”</p>



<p>Now, one EU official said, &#8220;the others will have to decide whether they want to stay with the core of defense integration or not.”</p>



<p>But the project is clouded with uncertainty —&nbsp;from determining who would benefit from the sales to whether it will actually survive political opposition in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not sure it will be constructed in the way it was proposed,” said Hannah Neumann, a German MEP with the left-leaning Greens. “We had a big debate in Germany, there’s a lot of frustration.”</p>



<p>Essentially, Neumann argued, the project encapsulates the inevitable challenges of any pan-European initiative.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s the poster child to study the problems that are being created if you want to build a European project — but everyone tries to safeguard their national authority over things,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the effects of climate change intensify, we must prepare Europe's urban centers to combat extreme heat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Eleni Myrivili is the chief heat officer of the city of Athens and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Kathy Baughman McLeod is the senior vice president and director of the Adrienne-Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center and chair of the Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance</em>.</p>



<p>The extreme heat endured by millions worldwide this summer continues to shatter records around the globe, offering a terrifying glimpse of the future and confirming the grim prophecy climate scientists have long predicted. But while&nbsp;efforts by cities to mitigate the impact of a warmer world are finally beginning to gain momentum, when it comes to preparedness, much more still needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The outlook for urban centers on an undeniably warming planet is grim.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/08/12/heat-dome-called-lucifer-causing-hellish-temperatures-wildfires/" target="_blank">brutal heat wave</a>&nbsp;that broiled southern Europe and northern Africa earlier this month saw&nbsp;16 Italian cities and 14 Portuguese districts&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-science-health-environment-and-nature-heat-waves-645440b90a8cfb48f9e728b28fe7408b" target="_blank">put on red alert</a>&nbsp;for health risks, all on the same day. Just three days earlier, the temperature in Syracuse, Sicily had hit 48.8°C&nbsp;— which, if verified, will be the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/climate/europe-italy-climate-temperature-sicily-vb9c5218f" target="_blank">highest ever recorded in Europe</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/july-was-earth-s-hottest-month-record-noaa-says-n1276764" target="_blank">July was the hottest month</a>&nbsp;on the planet since recordkeeping began 142 years ago.</p>



<p>Extreme heat poses a special danger in cities, where temperatures on a scorching summer day&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/09/climate/city-heat-islands.html" target="_blank">can vary as greatly as 20 degrees</a>&nbsp;across different neighborhoods. High concentrations of&nbsp;buildings and paved surfaces absorb and amplify heat, especially in areas with little tree cover or green space, creating&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/learn-about-heat-islands" target="_blank">heat islands</a>&nbsp;where poor neighborhoods so often bear the brunt of broiling temperatures.</p>



<p>By 2050,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.c40.org/other/the-future-we-don-t-want-for-cities-the-heat-is-on" target="_blank">more than 970 cities are expected to experience average summertime highs of 35˚C</a>&nbsp;— nearly triple the number that currently do.&nbsp;As a result, the urban population exposed to these sky-high temperatures will increase by 800 percent, reaching 1.6 billion by mid-century.</p>



<p>And yet, too few think of heat waves — a “<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/multimedia-article/extreme-heat-climate-change-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent killer</a>” that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heat-waves-cities-climate-change_n_5fad4e44c5b68707d1fcf7e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims more lives globally than any other weather-related hazard</a>&nbsp;— as a problem that warrants systematic long-term preparation.&nbsp;While many local governments have long maintained agencies specifically responsible for addressing threats from floods and fires, heat has had no owner, no season, no name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, efforts to help cities tackle extreme heat’s accelerating effects are finally gaining traction.&nbsp;In April, in the United States, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava named Jane Gilbert as interim chief heat officer (CHO), making her the first person in the world to hold the title. And on July 23, days before Greece suffered an unprecedented and record-breaking heat wave, Athens became the first European city to appoint a CHO.</p>



<p>The milestone was announced with the expressed support from the mayors of&nbsp;Glasgow, Paris, Rotterdam and Seville, each publicly underscoring the importance of prioritizing actions to build heat resilience all over Europe. The international scale of these endorsements signals the growing urgency by local governments to combat the burgeoning risks of extreme heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Addressing the problem, however, will need&nbsp;massive investments on several fronts, including high-quality tools to help decision makers assess heat risks; protective, heat-reducing projects in urban planning; policies that protect workers and implement standards for reduced impact; as well as the clear prioritization of our most vulnerable populations.</p>



<p>Some forward-thinking cities are already embracing solutions, establishing&nbsp;cooling centers,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-cool-roofs-reduce-heat-islands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cool</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-green-roofs-reduce-heat-islands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">green roofs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-cool-pavements-reduce-heat-islands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cool pavement</a>,&nbsp;which can all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heat-islands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce the urban heat island effect</a>. Cities like Vienna, Thessaloníki, Milan and Nice have created water fountains that are accessible for all and a variety of water elements, even temporary installations, to reduce temperatures and protect their oldest and youngest residents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Places like Barcelona, Stockholm, Milan and Padua have gotten creative when it comes to finding places for trees and cooling canopies, taking back parking spaces, planting trees along newly pedestrianizing streets and creating buildings with trees growing around every floor. Some have even planted little forests within (sometimes mobile) containers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many urban centers have also started collecting data and assessing heat risks, creating base-line studies, measuring their urban heat islands and evaluating their progress using thermal censoring and mapping.&nbsp;In 2016, for example, Athens&nbsp;launched a heat-wave action plan designed to protect its most at-risk residents and help lower city temperatures. And for the last few years, the city has made available a free smartphone app, “EXTREMA Global,” which calculates personalized heat risk in real time and suggests ways to cool down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onebillionresilient.org/post/extreme-heat-resilience-alliance-reducing-extreme-heat-risk-for-vulnerable-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance</a>&nbsp;(EHRA), a 30-plus member coalition of global climate scientists and experts from various disciplines, has been formed with the aim of using innovative tactics — like launching the City Champions for Heat Action initiative to designate chief heat officers — to&nbsp;protect lives and livelihoods from extreme heat. The Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, which founded EHRA, is also&nbsp;moving to establish a standard practice of naming and categorizing heat waves worldwide, in order to sound the alarm for an approaching emergency and trigger preparation by authorities and citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these tools are available to be immediately deployed in other urban centers, and with proper investment, many more can be developed.&nbsp;Still, we, as a global community, are at the very beginning of the Herculean undertaking necessary to protect people from the impact of soaring temperatures.&nbsp;We don’t have a minute to waste.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Europe is facing a pileup of era-defining moments, from Afghanistan's fall to disputes over  basic values. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Brussels&#8217;&nbsp;<em>rentrée</em>&nbsp;is coursing with uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of enjoying a typically low-key August, political leaders across Europe were being pulled back from vacations, tracked down for comment and confronted with an epochal development in Afghanistan: The Taliban were seizing control, and&nbsp;fast.</p>



<p>Now, with the last Western soldier having left Afghanistan and the Taliban fully in command, Europe will have to face existential questions about what the failed 20-year endeavor means for its place on the world stage. </p>



<p>That’s not the only destabilizing development facing Europe and the EU. </p>



<p>In Germany, the race to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel has unexpectedly tightened, raising the prospect of dramatic change in the continent’s richest country. In Brussels, EU officials will finally be forced to answer the era-defining question of how far will they go to enforce their stated values on countries like Hungary and Poland. And across the continent, the highly contagious delta variant is complicating reopening, pressuring the EU to prove it can live up to a promise to help vaccinate the rest of the world.</p>



<p>“I think that right now, our minds are occupied by superpower politics,” said Tytti Tuppurainen, Finland’s minister for European affairs. “What is the role of the EU in the global arena?”</p>



<p>The answers cut to the bloc&#8217;s core.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Democracies can succeed if they themselves believe in their values,” Tuppurainen argued. “And, conversely, if we lose our confidence in our values, if we lose confidence in ourselves, we are reduced to insignificance.”</p>



<p>Get ready —&nbsp;it&#8217;s Brussels’ autumn of anxiety.</p>



<h2>Afghanistan&#8217;s next chapter</h2>



<p>While Afghanistan has already fallen, fears over what this means for Europe are just beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary source of apprehension is a potential surge in Afghans seeking asylum. While EU leaders have made rhetorical gestures&nbsp;toward&nbsp;taking refugees, the bloc’s emerging plans focus almost exclusively on securing EU borders and keeping Afghan&nbsp;migrants&nbsp;away from them — even if this means funding resettlement efforts in countries like Iran and Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some European officials are so cautious of resettling Aghans within their borders they don&#8217;t even want to draw parallels to the influx of refugees from war-torn Syria in 2015, afraid the comparison will incentivize them to head for Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s an approach that has left activists queasy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EU leaders “uniting on these fears of refugee arrivals end up giving a big tool to EU neighbors&#8221; like Turkey, Belarus and Morocco, which use migrants as leverage to blackmail the EU, warned Oxfam&#8217;s EU migration policy adviser, Raphael Shilhav. </p>



<p>The Afghanistan fallout has also left Europe unsettled over its supposed closest ally, the U.S. </p>



<p>Many in Europe are still smarting over the U.S.&#8217;s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, leaving Europe and the NATO military alliance with little choice in the matter. </p>



<p>One EU official said the decision compounded existing frustration over America’s past approaches in Syria and Libya, both countries where some European officials felt the U.S. lost interest or failed to follow through on promises to intervene,&nbsp;leaving Europe to handle the resulting refugee surge.</p>



<p>Apprehension that the same situation is playing out again in Afghanistan — ironically under U.S. President Joe Biden, an avowed&nbsp;proponent of&nbsp;transatlanticism — is coming to a head. It’s left many Europeans wondering: Will the EU ever be able to control its own fate?</p>



<h2>The pandemic that won&#8217;t quit</h2>



<p>While the pandemic may not seem like a new source of anxiety for Europe, the full story is a bit more complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a rocky start, the EU reached its goal of vaccinating 70 percent of its adult citizens by the summer’s end. The bloc has also acquired far more doses than it needs to inoculate 100 percent of its population — if people are willing, that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many ways, the&nbsp;results are promising. Hospitalizations and deaths have dropped below 2020 levels, countries are inching back toward full reopenings, recovery funds are on the way and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_3323" target="_blank">predicted</a>&nbsp;back in June that EU economies would fully recover within 18 months.</p>



<p>Hanging over the good news, however, is a cloud of uncertainty. The delta variant has consumed Europe, causing case spikes and, occasionally, breaking through vaccine barriers. And some EU countries remain largely unvaccinated —&nbsp;Bulgaria, for instance, has only fully inoculated 20 percent of adults.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, concerns are growing over the potential waning effectiveness of vaccines over time. Some countries, including the U.K., Germany, France and Hungary, have already agreed to offer booster vaccine shots to elderly or medically vulnerable populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of course the COVID situation is still very much in our minds,” said Manfred Weber, leader of the European Parliament’s largest group, the center-right European People’s Party (EPP). “But this summer has shown us that vaccination really is the key to an open and free society in times of&nbsp;COVID.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His colleague, Iratxe García, president of the socialist S&amp;D group in Parliament, said the EU’s vaccination strategy was “going well on average,” arguing that “vaccination will allow us to gradually go back to normality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet that normality will inevitably take longer in the rest of the world — especially if the EU doesn’t follow through with its promises to help. While the bloc has vowed to donate 200 million doses to developing countries by the year’s end, it had only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-coronavirus-vaccine-donations-china-united-states/">delivered</a>&nbsp;7.9 million of those doses as of early August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the EU still hasn&#8217;t settled on a uniform approach to vaccinating children over 12, a key step given the presence of more contagious variants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We must continue [vaccination] with the young, even if some individual EU countries are lagging behind,” García said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Peter Liese, a German MEP from the EPP, vaccinating children will be “a big issue for the autumn.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my view, it’s very important to have the approval ASAP,” he said. “Children are not really in danger, but there’s a problem for risk groups like those who have Down syndrome.”</p>



<p>Then there’s the money.&nbsp;EU countries are poised to receive a windfall in the coming months — €750 billion in total.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need more than that to deal with the economic shock of the pandemic,” Weber said. “We need more determination in our international trade agenda and to cut red tape for businesses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Germany&#8217;s new leader(s)</h2>



<p>The German election on September 26 adds another layer of uncertainty to the mix, and not just because&nbsp;Merkel — often described as Europe’s de facto leader — is stepping aside after 16 years in office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polls in Germany are tightening, with no strong lead for any party. This means not only could the next chancellor come from a different party but the government will likely also become a three-party coalition, up from the current two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;would increase&nbsp;the risk of long and difficult coalition talks&nbsp;and&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;Berlin’s ability to help guide Europe through turbulent periods. After the last election in 2017, it already took nearly half a year to form a ruling coalition.</p>



<p>Germany is “at a crucial turning point,” said Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). It needs an “assertive federal government” that can “take groundbreaking decisions on climate protection, digital transformation, social policy and Europe.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A three-party coalition can’t do that, he&nbsp;argued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such an arrangement would “require major compromises, especially since there is a strong split in the parties&#8217; visions for the future,” he said. “Some parties focus on tax cuts and debt reduction, others on investing in the future. There is, therefore, a great danger that the next federal government will lack the courage and unity to implement the necessary reforms.”</p>



<p>In recent days, Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democratic Party has&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;moved to the front of the pack, polling ahead of Armin Laschet from Merkel’s conservative party and the Green Party’s Annalena Baerbock.</p>



<h2>The EU confronts its own values</h2>



<p>Amid all this, the EU is poised to reenter the ring for a fight over its democratic norms.</p>



<p>The bloc will soon have to make a decision on whether to approve&nbsp;Hungary’s pandemic recovery funding plan&nbsp;after holding off over the lack of anti-corruption protections. And it will also decide in the coming weeks whether to approve a similar plan from Poland, another country it remains locked in a dispute with over adherence to&nbsp;its rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressure is&nbsp;mounting on the Commission to finally use a mechanism allowing it to cut off EU funding to countries it believes aren&#8217;t upholding the rule of law, and both Hungary and Poland are topping the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This might be the defining moment of the von der Leyen Commission,” said German Green MEP Daniel Freund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Domestic political uncertainty in Budapest and Warsaw will likely exacerbate tensions.&nbsp;Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party is entering a tough campaign ahead of a parliamentary election in spring 2022, and opted to double down on its conspiratorial rhetoric and confrontations with Brussels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fidesz has&nbsp;also&nbsp;pushed ahead with implementing a controversial anti-LGBTQ+ measure that bars the depiction of homosexuality to minors —&nbsp;the same law that derailed an entire meeting of EU leaders&nbsp;as they&nbsp;implored Orbán to reverse course or risk&nbsp;undermining&nbsp;the EU’s core values.</p>



<p>The bloc&#8217;s longstanding concerns about media freedom, judicial independence and rampant corruption within Hungary all remain unaddressed.&nbsp;In Poland, conversely,&nbsp;the government has signaled a willingness to pull back from one element of its disputed judicial reforms, which EU officials say endangered the country’s legal system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts have noted, however, that this is far from the meaningful U-turn the EU wants. Poland&#8217;s ruling Law and Justice party, for instance, which currently leads an unstable minority government, continues to doubt the primacy of EU law —&nbsp;questioning&nbsp;a foundational element of the economic and political union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, one senior Commission official said that while it will be a “hot autumn” in the EU values arena, they are “upbeat” on what can be accomplished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have all the things in place,” the official said, pointing to the mechanism linking EU funding to rule-of-law pledges, as well as plans to propose new media freedom legislation. “There&#8217;s a challenge for unity, but my mood is actually quite positive because I think we can show the way.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Qin Gang warns of “disastrous consequences” if the US seeks to suppress China using a “Cold War playbook.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp;— China’s newly minted ambassador to the United States arrived only in July, but the honeymoon is already over. Qin Gang on Tuesday reinforced his reputation as a sharp-edged avatar of Chinese diplomacy<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zmgxss/t1903557.htm" target="_blank">&nbsp;with a speech that excoriated U.S. “wrong beliefs”</a>&nbsp;and cautioned against violating Beijing’s “red line” of core interests in areas including the South China Sea, Taiwan and Xinjiang.</p>



<p>In his most substantive public statement yet, Qin pointed ominously to China’s nuclear weapons capability and warned of “disastrous consequences” if the U.S. seeks to suppress China using a “Cold War playbook.”</p>



<p>Speaking via video link to a select audience of China wonks and foreign policy heavyweights — including Henry Kissinger, former U.S. ambassador to Beijing Stapleton Roy and former assistant secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, Susan Thornton — China’s ambassador said those who argue his country would meet the same fate as the former Soviet Union show a “serious ignorance of history and China.”</p>



<p>Qin’s speech at the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations underscores his history as an early pioneer of the aggressive “wolf warrior” style of diplomacy that is increasingly defining Beijing’s approach to the United States and the world.</p>



<p>As a Foreign Ministry spokesperson from 2005-2010, he would mock members of the media,&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/08/10/qin-gang-china-ambassador-us-xi-jinping-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">once telling a journalist</a>&nbsp;“ not to report based on your delusions.” In February as vice foreign minister, he responded to a journalist’s query about “wolf warrior” diplomacy by&nbsp;<a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202102/10/WS6023428ba31024ad0baa8865.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excoriating “evil wolves”</a>&nbsp;for negative reporting about China.</p>



<p>Upon taking up his new post, Qin<a href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zmgxss/t1895885.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;struck a conciliatory tone</a>&nbsp;at a time of high tensions with the United States. He promised to “endeavor to bring China-U.S. relations back on track, turning the way for the two countries to get along with each other.” But his comments Tuesday suggest he will continue to deploy a bare-knuckle style of diplomatic engagement that has curdled<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2021/07/27/china-relationship-worsens-796744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;recent high-level bilateral meetings in Anchorage and the Chinese port city of Tianjin</a>&nbsp;into vitriolic standoffs.</p>



<p>Qin’s speech offered a measure of hope, noting that China sees opportunity for substantive bilateral cooperation on existential issues including climate change and containing COVID-19 worldwide. He referenced the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/10/985803697/50-years-later-the-legacy-of-u-s-china-pingpong-diplomacy-faces-challenges" target="_blank">ping-pong diplomacy</a>” that paved the way to the establishment of U.S-China diplomatic relations in 1979 and said he was committed to a “more rational, stable, manageable and constructive China-U.S. relationship.”</p>



<p>But the bulk of his presentation drilled down on the Chinese government’s dissatisfaction with what it perceives as U.S. politicians dedicated to “suppressing China” and cautioned against the U.S. government depicting China as &#8220;its rival and imaginary enemy, just like when Don Quixote tilted at windmills.&#8221;</p>



<p>The list of Qin’s grievances ranged from a warning against U.S. support for<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/us/politics/biden-china-taiwan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Taiwan independence</a>&nbsp;to criticism of the Biden administration’s endorsement of a<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/25/who-china-investigation-covid-probe-500711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;World Health Organization probe into the origins of the coronavirus</a>.</p>



<p>U.S. government restrictions on the operations of<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/biden-blocks-59-chinese-companies-including-huawei-in-amended-trump-order-121060400185_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;blacklisted Chinese telecom equipment firm Huawei&nbsp;</a>and a raft of China-focused draft legislation moving through Congress drew his most concentrated fire.</p>



<p>Qin accused the Biden administration of leveraging “state power to bring down Huawei” and warned that the passage of legislation, including the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3535?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22EAGLES+Act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;EAGLES Act</a>&nbsp;and the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1260?s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Innovation and Competition Act of 2021,</a>&nbsp;“will hijack China-U.S. relations and gravely damage America&#8217;s own interests.”</p>



<p>That uncompromising language suggests that Qin’s tenure as ambassador will be characterized by confrontation in the face of deepening bipartisan skepticism about the quality and direction of the U.S.-China relationship.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The WHO's director general urged countries to consider the idea in the pandemic treaty that is being written. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>German Health Minister Jens Spahn called for sanctions Wednesday against countries that hide information about future outbreaks.</p>



<p>Citing the World Trade Organization’s power to sanction countries for noncompliance, Spahn said “there must be something that follows” if countries fail to live up to commitments under a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-succeeds-in-efforts-to-delay-pandemic-treaty/">new pandemic treaty</a> that the World Health Assembly will take up in November.</p>



<p>The proposal for sanctions from a major EU country — a not-so-subtle dig at China — marks a major shift in tone as Western governments accuse Beijing of preventing a full investigation into how the novel coronavirus emerged.</p>



<p>World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also urged countries to consider the idea as they take up the treaty, a legally binding tool to better prevent, detect and respond to future pandemics. The treaty should <strong>“</strong>have all the incentives, or the carrots” to encourage transparency, Tedros said, appearing at a press conference with Spahn in Berlin. “But maybe exploring the sanctions may be important,” he added.</p>



<p>The idea of giving the WHO enforcement authority has traditionally been a non-starter. While the EU is a champion of the pandemic treaty, its <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/pandemic-treaty/" target="_blank">proposal</a> has so far emphasized carrots, not sticks.</p>



<p>Spahn and Tedros made their comments at the inauguration of&nbsp;a new <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1810288">virus-monitoring center</a> in Berlin, dubbed the WHO&nbsp;Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence. Spahn used the occasion to call on countries to put “sufficient financial resources” behind pandemic monitoring. </p>



<p>The health minister, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right party, acknowledged that such disclosure would be awkward for any country. But he called on China “to finally become fully cooperative, and to make the explanation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/13/g-7-nations-covid-origin-china-494004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">origin</a>&nbsp;of the coronavirus transparent to the international community.”</p>



<p>“I have asked myself several times, if it had started in Germany or a European country, or the U.S., how would we have cooperated with the WHO? Because of course there are so many dimensions to it: politics, prestige, science,” Spahn said. The debate over sanctions, he added, is “not an easy debate, but I think it is a necessary debate.”</p>



<p>Merkel was also in attendance to formally inaugurate the new center, which was set up as part of Germany’s growing role as a global health&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1441606">leader</a>. Last year, Berlin was the WHO’s top donor and spearheaded talks over reforming the Geneva-based U.N. agency.</p>



<p>An initial $100 million investment by the German government is funding the hub, which will be led by Chikwe&nbsp;Ihekweazu, currently director general of the&nbsp;Nigeria&nbsp;Centre for&nbsp;Disease&nbsp;Control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, the hub will operate out of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.charite.de/en/" target="_blank">Charité</a>&nbsp;medical and research facility, but will eventually relocate to a permanent facility in the capital&#8217;s Kreuzberg district. It will be responsible for detecting and monitoring virus events that have the potential to turn into pandemics.&nbsp;</p>
